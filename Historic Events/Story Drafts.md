# Story Drafts
Much like the title suggests, these are drafts for the story surrounding Luniks as a whole. This project will be grand, and span a small percentage of all of Earth's history. Key points can be found in [List of Historic Events](https://github.com/BlackCatMS/Luniks/blob/main/Historic%20Events/List%20of%20historic%20events.md).

## Leremkov Trials
A broad definition and explanation of the Leremkov Trials is that Dr. Vitaly Leremkov altered human DNA over the span of 30 years, altering the DNA of a significant amount of humanity over this time, giving them animalistic traits, such as the sense of smell of a dog or antlers like a deer. 

Much like Leremkov, stories that grow big enough and no longer end up fitting as drafts will end up in their own document. 

The Leremkov Trials as a whole is a big project. Below is a draft image of the content the Leremkov Trials had to mention.

### Vitaly Leremkov
Vitaly Leremkov's story has grown too big to remain a draft. It is now available as a [separate entry](https://github.com/BlackCatMS/Luniks/blob/main/Historic%20Events/Vitaly%20Leremkov%2C%202039-2098.md).

### David & Stacy
Background information: David is a student at the university in Antwerpen. This takes place around 20-25 after Leremkov's first series of DNA alterations in Cévok, Kerisant. Stacy is the daughter of two people affected by this DNA alteration, and has been born with this altered DNA. For his graduation, David researched the effects of the vaccinations from Leremkov on the human genome, learning that Stacy has been an indirect victim of this.

#### Drafted story
Spinning idly in his chair, David — a student scientist and biologist at the hospital in Antwerpen — twirled his pen through his fingers, deeply lost in thought with his paperwork right before him. A due date of October 30th in bold, red text up top. Looking up to the clock above his desk, he watches the seconds tick by before dropping his pen on the table, finally having found the determination to finish up his project.  
  
Turning the pages of his notebook, he suddenly pauses as he reads the name of someone familiar to him, Stacy Eweyck. Scanning the page quickly, his focus reaches its highest point as he reads "Leremkov" again and again, reading her symptoms, reading her attributes, but one thing stands out to him, as he whispers to himself out loud. "No vaccines, no contact, but birth-given?"  
  
David picked his pen back up, as he picks up a new sheet of paper. Slowly but surely he begins copying his own notes of her symptoms, her fox-like personality, her vibrant orange tail, her big and furry fox ears. Putting a line under "BORN THIS WAY" at the bottom of his newly created note, he steps out of his chair and sprints to his professor. If people can be born with these attributes, just how badly has Leremkov poisoned humanity?


## Oslo Revolution
The Oslo Revolution originally happened in 2247, and was first drafted in 2018 in the so-called "Alva-Line project", which has evolved countless times into where we are today with the Luniks project. Putting away the worries of repurposing the entire project and events in 2247 in Oslo, all I'd like to note here is that this will eventually happen! As of right now, the main planning is to properly note down the main outline of the project and the main timeline of Luniks, and slowly but surely Oslo will gain it's time and place where it will finally fall, as Nóve Osló doesn't have a similar reason for existence like Nóve Réjkjavik.
