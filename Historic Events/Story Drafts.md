# Story Drafts
Much like the title suggests, these are drafts for the story surrounding Luniks as a whole. This project will be grand, and span a small percentage of all of Earth's history. Key points can be found in [[List of Historic Events]]. 

## Leremkov Trials
A broad definition and explanation of the Leremkov Trials is that Dr. Vitaly Leremkov altered human DNA over the span of 30 years, altering the DNA of a significant amount of humanity over this time, giving them animalistic traits, such as the sense of smell of a dog or antlers like a deer. 

Much like Leremkov, stories that grow big enough and no longer end up fitting as drafts will end up in their own document. 

The Leremkov Trials as a whole is a big project. Below is a draft image of the content the Leremkov Trials had to mention.

### Vitaly Leremkov
Vitaly Leremkov's story has grown too big to remain a draft. It is now available as a [separate entry](Vitaly%20Leremkov,%202039-2098).

### David & Stacy
Background information: David is a student at the university in Antwerpen. This takes place around 20-25 after Leremkov's first series of DNA alterations in Cévok, Kerisant. Stacy is the daughter of two people affected by this DNA alteration, and has been born with this altered DNA. For his graduation, David researched the effects of the vaccinations from Leremkov on the human genome, learning that Stacy has been an indirect victim of this.

#### Drafted story
Spinning idly in his chair, David — a student scientist and biologist at the hospital in Antwerpen — twirled his pen through his fingers, deeply lost in thought with his paperwork right before him. A due date of October 30th in bold, red text up top. Looking up to the clock above his desk, he watches the seconds tick by before dropping his pen on the table, finally having found the determination to finish up his project.  
  
Turning the pages of his notebook, he suddenly pauses as he reads the name of someone familiar to him, Stacy Eweyck. Scanning the page quickly, his focus reaches its highest point as he reads "Leremkov" again and again, reading her symptoms, reading her attributes, but one thing stands out to him, as he whispers to himself out loud. "No vaccines, no contact, but birth-given?"  
  
David picked his pen back up, as he picks up a new sheet of paper. Slowly but surely he begins copying his own notes of her symptoms, her fox-like personality, her vibrant orange tail, her big and furry fox ears. Putting a line under "BORN THIS WAY" at the bottom of his newly created note, he steps out of his chair and sprints to his professor. If people can be born with these attributes, just how badly has Leremkov poisoned humanity?

#### What comes after?
My planned outline for this particular is story is that it will grow into a short novel of some sorts. David would gradually dive deeper into his research about the Leremkov vaccines, and during this process learn how Stacy lives her otherwise normal life with this vastly different strain of DNA. In the end, it'll probably end up being a cheesy romance story with a bit of mysterious vibes, but I expect it to remain nothing but drafts that loosely connect to one another. 

##### A first hand experience?
It might also be an idea for David to experience the vast difference between humanity as he knows it, and humanity as Stacy knows it, completely by himself. I purposely excluded the current year on David's due date for his work, meaning that this story could very well take place while Leremkov, or his namesake, to still be around and actively dose people. Keeping in mind that **David and Stacy are 22-24 years old** would mean that the story should take place around **2095-2098**.


## Oslo Revolution
The Oslo Revolution originally happened in 2247, and was first drafted in 2018 in the so-called "Alva-Line project", which has evolved countless times into where we are today with the Luniks project. Putting away the worries of repurposing the entire project and events in 2247 in Oslo, all I'd like to note here is that this will eventually happen! As of right now, the main planning is to properly note down the main outline of the project and the main timeline of Luniks, and slowly but surely Oslo will gain it's time and place where it will finally fall, as Nóve Osló doesn't have a similar reason for existence like Nóve Réjkjavik.


## Máneá-Zakh'háfo Conflict / Collapse of United Máneá
The title should be read as cause -> effect. The sudden split between Mánea and Zakh'háfo caused not only Zakh'háfo to crumble into economical and political discourse and instability, this also opened up doors to provinces and areas which were located between the two newly-formed countries to fight for their own independence too, most notably being Rhódiś. 

### Máneá-Zakh'háfo conflict
Note: This is part of a draft first made in 2020, and might contain content that no longer exists, or never properly existed. It might be highly inaccurate within the present state of the project.

*"4th century since Linuksian calendar was put into practise. End of united territories on Mánéa continent. Leaving behind devastation, the Zachháfon territories are too little to be able to regain economic development, causing a depression. Soon after the empire pulls out of Mánéa, the Union of Three (Kérisánt, Ellíttróómi, and the Mónsan Republic) declare war on THórirsánt. This event also causes the Kérisántic revolution, ultimately leading to the disbanding of the Union of Three."*

- *Zachháfon economic crisis (AL 447 - 468)*
- *Mánéan splitting (AL 448)*

A few things to note: The **Luniksan calendar** only existed as a draft in the past, and no longer exists as a concept as Luniks continued using the internatially recognised Gregorian calendar. The **"Empire"** refers to the Thórirsantic Empire. This too, has been off the drawing board since 2021 and no longer exists as a concept given the change of pace and vision of the project, focusing on unification between nations on the planet, rather than full-scale conflict. The **Union of Three**, specifically the **Mónsan Republic**, no longer exist. The Union of Three was repurposed into an economic union between Thórirsant, Kerisant, and United Máneá, later becoming a union with Álusken instead of Máneá, before the idea of an economic union was scrapped completely. The only surviving part of this text is the **Mónsan Republic**, which remains a concept with a blank history and no location on the map, however, this is still planned.

### Collapse of United Máneá
There's currently no proper date for when United Máneá is officially declared and recognised as a split nation. The Luniksan calendar would suggest that this takes place in Anno Luniks 447, which would be roughly 480 years after the colonisation of Luniks. This would take a very long time, and with existing characters interacting with others that live around the late 21st century, the Collapse of Máneá will probably take place around the year 2090-2100 mark.
