# CLOSURE
**CLOSURE** is the event in which a Ghost bids farewell to the world once more, in a more controlled manner, as compared to when they initially lost their lives prematurely before their **Last Light**. As of now (March 2024), the only Ghost to have gone through this stage is *Cziskvelén*, as he is also the oldest Ghost to have roamed the *Elevated Realm*. 

## CLOSURE // CZISKVELÉN
### Farewell, Vászi
Holding his hand out, one foot into the Chroma, the other still outside, Cziskvelén speaks to Vászi one last time, carrying him into the same experience that he once experienced many, many years ago. It had been over 50 years since he was fatally shot on a mission in **United Máneá**, and ever since he was guided by Chroma and its Higher Spirits to guide the many Ghosts that were follow into their new lives. But despite this life that he had now lived for so long, it turned out that life did continue like normal, and just like every other Ghost, he continued to age like normal. It's been over 50 years, and Cziskvelén was now nearing his 90s. The end of his life by natural means was in sight, and the destiny that he once carried he would grant to Vászi.

The Chroma split itself into two, one stayed beside Vászi, the other beside Cziskvelén. An uneasy, awkward, and grim mood filled the black void they had stepped into, the only sources of lights being the glittering of the reflections in the two Chromas, which gave the white mantles the two Ghosts were wearing a rainbow shine. 

In an attempt to break the awkward silence between the two, Cziskvelén reaches out his hand to Vászi, a warm smile on his face. **"Shape their world, Vászi.**

**Wherever I may go, I will watch over you, and I will guard you."**

With a lump in his throat, Vászi barely managed to respond, clearly struggling to come to terms with the reality that he was about to bid farewell to the person that gave him his next chance in life, his next life as a whole. He held Cziskvelén's hand as tight as he could, holding back tears as best as he could, fully aware that his experience in his First Light would be torture. Just like Cziskvelén had described, the First Light would feel infinite, the Chroma would haunt him, as only those that the Chroma deems ready, will be able to go through the Temple. Vászi knew that he was the right choice, with both Cziskvelén and the Chroma itself backing him, but even then, bidding farewell to the person that revived him, to go through hell and back, just to return like normal? It wouldn't be a challenge for just his mind to endure and process, but his body, his everything, it seemed impossible, it seemed hopeless.

Still holding Vászi's hand, Cziskvelén steps forward, now standing mere centimetres before him. **"I know just how tough it is to say farewell to a person so important in your life, Vászi, more than you would expect me to know. It hadn't dawned upon me until my last couple of years, that I had enforced that exact feeling upon innocents in my life before my current. I used to be a hitman, I used to kill people over mishaps, over misunderstandings, leaving their families in dismay."**

Vászi's expression changed from hopeless to confused, unsure what message Cziskvelén was trying to convey to him, as Cziskvelén continued to explain. **"I realised I was robbing people of their lives, so when my own life was robbed and taken, Chroma granted me the power that I'm now granting you. The power to guide people that died prematurely into the Realm we find ourselves in right now. I recognise how horrible a person I was, taking lives from innocents, and that is why I was granted the power to revive those people, the power which I now carry over to you."**

*"I think I.. understand now."* Vászi replied, fighting emotions and discomfort, still struggling to come to terms with the reality he was about to face, but slowly but surely nodding, knowing there was no other end in sight. Cziskvelén couldn't be saved, just like nobody can save the elderly from dying of old age. \
**"My time nears, Vászi, and yours will soon commence."** \
*"I-I understand.. Cziskvelén. I won't.. let Chroma go to waste, I won't let any soul behind, just like you did, just like the legacy foretold."* \
Slowly letting go of each other's hands, the two bid each other farewell one last time, knowing that fate wouldn't put a pause to anything, knowing that everything was destined. With a tear escaping Vászi's eye, rolling down his cheek, the Chroma beside him slowly encapsulating him, transferring him into his First Light, as he manages to say one last thing before disappearing.

*"Thank you, Cziskvelén, farewell."*

### Farewell, Chroma
*POV: Cziskvelén* \
Together with the blackness of the void surrounding and covering all of Vászi's body, the same blackness began to seep into the corners of my own eyes, surrounded by the rainbow glimmering of the Chroma. It didn't take long before I saw the gate of Chroma disappear from my field of view, and gravity ceased to exist. Without wind, without weight, I floated in the infiniteness of blackness, stars, and rainbows, until I saw the Eye of Chroma appear before me, filling up the empty void as far as my eyes could see, just like in my First Light.

**"Had you not been reborn by Chroma back then, your original death would look like this."** The metallic voice echoed into the void, although in a much more pleasant tone as compared to my First Light, when I first met the Chroma. Feeling like I had nothing to lose anymore at this point, I replied quietly, already having come to peace with my end. *"In the end, I guess it's no different from dying naturally. I've lived my life to my fullest, I've brought life back for so many Ghosts. Just like me, they can now live onwards and experience life and death like normal."*

The rainbow lines of the Chroma began to shimmer more brightly, as if it was pleased to hear that answer. **"You have exerted yourself all your life long, Cziskvelén. Upon your death, you wil exit my grasp, and you will finally be able to rest eternally."**

I felt my body slowly begin to numb down, my eyes struggled to stay open, my motor functions started to fail and my heartbeat started to become irregular. My last breath was nearing, and I knew I couldn't stay here much longer. 

*"Chroma, thank you.."*

**"It's been an honour, Cziskvelén. Rest easy. May we one day reunite in infinity."**

I closed my eyes, a feeling of tiredness washing over me, overwhelming me. A few more breaths, and I could feel my mind drift away into a deep sleep. The feeling of numbness in my body increased exponentially, the feeling of weightlessness increased, as I felt the Chroma let go of me, its rainbow hands that had held me for all these years, finally laying me down in the void, putting me to rest.

And so, I smile widely and at peace. After this long, I was finally comfortable with accepting death. The last thoughts to enter my mind were imagining just how much further Vászi could progress where I am letting it go now. I felt comfortable, I felt safe. And so, my last breath exits my body, and I drift off to sleep.

Forever.
