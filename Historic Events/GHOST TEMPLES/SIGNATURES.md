# GHOST TEMPLES // SIGNATURES
All existing ghosts can gather *Spiritual Energy* and use this in various different ways. Below is a list of said **Signatures**, as they are most commonly referred to, and how they are used.

## Settler of Vászi  
**Signature:** Guarding Light  \
Upon casting his signature, Vászi will levitate himself above the ground as various tiny particles begin forming around him. With the chime of a church bell, a light from the heavens will strike down on Vászi, as he then channels this energy to his surroundings, forming an invisible dome in which every being within it will gain extra resistance and energy.  

**Signature (2)**: Blade of Cziskvelén \
Upon casting his signature, Vászi summons the *Blade of Cziskvelén*, which he will lift high up towards the sky, causing him to levitate in similar fashion to **Guarding Light**. Much like that signature, a light from the heavens will strike the blade and lead to the ring of a church bell, however, this will not form a protective dome, and instead, Vászi will strike the blade forwards and channel the immense energy towards the enemy force.

**Signature (3)**: A Promise Kept \
Combining the **Guarding Light** and **Blade of Cziskvelén** signatures, Vászi summons the Blade and holds it upright, summoning and forming a shallow, golden-coloured dome in which new glowing particles will form. Upon the chime of a church bell, a light from the heavens will strike down on Vászi, channelling through the blade and himself. Wherever Cziskvelén may be, the particles will form into an arrow or spear pointing at that direction. With a swift motion, he will position the Blade in the direction of the particles, and to Cziskvelén. And with a quick strike, the dome will vanish, the light will channel through the blade, leaving behind an arrow of light and a gust of wind.

## Guardian Marten
**Signature**: Healing Pulse \
A simple healing pulse. Carried over during his Rebirth, he retained his knowledge within his health science, and uses this to support and heal others if needed. Upon casting, his right hand will start to glow a faint amber colour, which will also reflect in his eyes, and upon pressing against his target directly or from a short range, he can boost their strength and stamina, or help them recover more quickly from inflicted wounds or pain.

**Signature (2)**: Guarding Light \
Similarly to Vászi, Sóvis, and every other Guardian to ever have guarded a Temple, it's vital to know how to master the **Guarding Light** signature. Traditionally, the light from the heavens that strikes down upon the casting of the signature is a bright and vibrant yellow colour. In Marten's case, however, this is a deeper, amber-coloured pulse, mirroring the colour of his **Healing Pulse**. 

## Luna  
**Signature**: Curious Eye  \
Their time in Matéiazhu has given Luna enough time to develop their own signature. From afar, Luna is able to see a person in a distance and immediately learn basic info about them, with more information being collected the longer the gaze stays connected. Upon disconnection from their target, the gained information stays, which may be useful for a future endeavour, or even a threat to the Temple.

**Signature (2)**:  Shadow Dash \
Channelling the ancient spirit that they carved into the Oni mask, its spirit activates and they begin to focus on the destination they intent to reach. A thick smoke, of which the colour can vary, will seep into the mouthpiece of the mask, which will give Luna the energy and strength they need to take the leap forward. Within the blink of an eye and the snap of a blade, their form vanishes and will reappear in the target destination. Combined with Curious Eye, Luna could use this signature to analyse a potential enemy, and depending on the possible threat, they can use the Shadow Dash to leap forward and confront the target.
  
## Snow
**Signature**: Whiteout (Personal Space)  \
While Snow continues to struggle to adapt to her new form, she developed a signature in which she summons a white space, devoid of any other beings but those she's comfortable with, for her to collect her thoughts or regain a moment of peace.

**Signature (2)**: Channelling Astárout \
Utilizing a strength from far beyond the realms of discovered Luniks, Snow has discovered and learned how to channel the powers of the Ancient Spirit of Astárout. This allows her to gain extra strength in dire situations, as described in her **EXPOSURE** entry, where she combined this signature with Whiteout to confront the **Junior Guardian Marten**. As she channels Astárout, her eyes (which are usually a faint, light blue) will glow brightly, as well waving blue fire appearing on her right arm, the tip of her ears and tail. Lastly, the black spots on her right ear (which she reflected in her mask) will also turn a deep, vibrant blue that pulses wildly.

## Winter
**Signature**: Arctic Blaze \
Similarly to Snow's *Whiteout*, Winter summons a shallow dome within a snowstorm that traps and encompasses only the targets she intends to cast her Signature on. She frequently mentions that she "Feels home in the snow", which is why she also uses her Arctic Blaze similarly to Snow's Whiteout, when she feels like she needs to regain a moment of peace.

**Signature (2)**: Channelling Leopald: \
Similarly to Snow's *Channelling Astárout*, Winter channels the ancient power of the **Spirit of Leopald**, a myth in Álusken's culture, to give her an extra surge of energy and strength.
