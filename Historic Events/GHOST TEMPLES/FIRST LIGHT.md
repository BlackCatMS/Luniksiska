## FIRST LIGHT // CZISKVELÉN
### Drafted story
// *This is a draft, nothing that is currently written will 1:1 reflect on the final story, and merely serves as a braindump session*

**FIRST LIGHT** marks the beginning of the complete story of **GHOST TEMPLES** as a whole. It is widely believed that *Cziskvelén* is sometimes considered to be a **God** to an extent, as he is commonly seen as the first Ghost to set foot on the world that the Temples find themselves in. What I'd like to achieve with this story, is to shine light on Cziskvelén's own stages of death and rebirth, where he is guided by a *Higher Spirit* (Who are still a mysterious and untouchable concept), and ever since settled the first temples and helped a series of Ghosts go through the same stages over and over again, bringing life into what was once believed to be the true end.
