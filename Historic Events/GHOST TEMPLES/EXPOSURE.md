### Eyes Meet (Subject to tweaks)
**// Subject to tweaks**: Originally, I wanted Luna to be unaware of the Ghost Temples existing as a whole, especially being unaware that there was an underlying connection. After the creation of *REBIRTH // SNOW*, this approach changed, and drastically changed the timescales as well. Because of this, several tweaks need to be put through the currently drafted story so that it becomes more in line with *EXPOSURE // SNOW*. Tweaks might include:
- Revealing the mysterious girl is also a ghost.
- Adjusting time scales so that the story doesn't take place after "All those years"
- Implement a signature use to reflect the modern idea of an Exposure entry

Roaming through the vivid and bright streets of Matéiazhu, hidden behind a mask and seen by nobody, is a young ghost. They lost their lives in a shock derailment incident on their way home from Zhuehai to Benelux, in the first deadly rail incident since the opening of the planetary rail network, at least 30 years prior. Ever since, they've been stuck in Zhuehai, forever longing to go home, but instead needing to find comfort behind a mask, roaming through the streets, eyeing every passerby, some familiars, mostly strangers. With their head down, they reach behind a corner store, taking a seat on top of the garbage collector, their hand resting on their cheek as they stare into the busy street. Every single night has passed like this. Staring at the busy street, eager and desperate to join the masses, but just being invisible to everyone, hidden behind a mask.  \
*"Is everything alright? You look exhausted.."* a young voice suddenly sounds behind them. Shockingly, they turn around, now facing a girl of about 19 years old, gazing deeply into their eyes. Completely taken aback by the situation, they stare back, their voice long gone as the girl gradually grows impatient. *"I don't have all day, I can help if you want me to"*.  \
Struggling to find the right words, knowing they last spoke a word all those years ago on the train, they lift their hand, pointing at the girl. **"You can.. see me?**" They ask, a raspy, distinct, yet slightly digitalized voice coming from behind the mask. In response, the girl nods, her already low amount of fear and doubt dropping to the floor as she draws closer, analysing the ghost's mask. *"You have a mesmerizing mask, it's so delicate.. Is it handmade?"* She tenderly asks, making clear she means no harm in the slightest.  \
**"It's.. old.. but made by myself."** The ghost mutters back, slowly regaining their long lost comfort in speaking, as they loosen up as well, gradually gaining trust in this mysterious girl before him. "I must know", they start, as they slowly drop down from the garbage collector, **"How are you able to see me? You are the first in years, this should be impossible."**  \
Instead of directly answering the question, the curious girl continues to overanalyse the ghost's mask, eager to point out smaller details, finding a crescent moon mark, the emblem of Vestia, and the symbol of Jérrat, beautifully integrated into the mask's white and gold colourway. Suddenly, she breaks the now minute-long silence, carefully looking into their eyes. *"It's strange. I've seen you around more often, as well as other masked people. I thought everyone systematically ignored you, but if I'm alone in being able to see you..-"*  \
The ghost suddenly interrupts, with their hand on their chest, gripping tightly on their suit. **"I've seen other ghosts. An Ox's mask, a Fox's mask, oddest of all, a broken mask of a Deer. If you've seen them too, it must be a sign. It must mean something."**  \
Nodding slowly, the girl's confidence seems to stagger as her eyes now face the floor, eyeing the ghost's shoes, but not in detail. Speaking softly, she gradually looks back up to face the ghost's mask. *"I've been meaning to ask, but if I may, what is your name?"*  \
A shiver runs through the ghost's phantom body, as flashbacks suddenly race through their mind. A vision of the train, a vision of family, all sorts of familiar faces, familiar places, seemingly so far away, as words and names refuse to formulate and connect. Raising their hand to their face, they once more struggle to collect words, before finally looking back into the girls eyes, responding confidently and clearly.  \
**"I am Luna. For now, that is all that matters."**

### What's next?
For **EXPOSURE // LUNA**, the main approach is following Luna through their story and describe their experience as a ghost, starting from the very moment of the rail incident in Zhuehai, all the way towards the complete connection of temples spread throughout the planet, maybe even hinting at temples located back at Earth?

This is a very bold and rough draft because I struggle to properly put it to words and have it flow nicely into an actual story. Nevertheless, this is exciting to me because it showcases one of Snow's personal strengths, rather than her weaknesses.  

### Of All Colours
*POV: Snow*  \
It's been a few weeks ever since. Day in, day out, I met with Vászi at the temple. We'd go through the different halls, the different divisions and wings that were underground, hidden away from other sources of life, except for the occasional group of deer that showed up in our forest. But it hasn't been too long, I've learned to adapt, I've learned to live with what I have now, even after death. 

Today, Vászi gave me a day to rest and recover, so I chose to spend that time at the edge of the forest with a grand view over the flower fields. Knowing that I'd have this view, I brought my mask and a brush, as the hours slowly began to pass as I began to gradually add colour to the mask, watching the sun gradually pass from noon to dusk while my ears continuously and frantically scan around, picking up all sorts of sounds from the nature surrounding me. From the birds flying through and out of the treetops, the wind gently shaking up the leaves, and the soft rustle from the waving flower field before me.

Suddenly, the peaceful sound of nature is broken as I hear a series of footsteps and cracking leaves approach me, their sound getting louder and louder with each step as my ears perk upright, facing to what's behind me, tracing the sound. My heart begins to pound in my chest, as I decide to stay put. *"Surely I'm imagining things, no?"* I ask myself, every single possibility rushing through my mind as I try to crack the code as to who might be stepping towards me. Do they know I'm here? Have then seen me? *Can* they see me?  
  
The footsteps quiet down, having stopped right behind my back, the stranger's warmth radiating against my tail as I do my best to keep myself upright and cautious, still having no idea what might happen next, before hearing one last step taken forward. From pure instinct, I felt like the stranger was reaching their hand out to touch me. In the blink of an eye, I turn around, my right hand coated in a blue, waving fire as I reach for the stranger's neck, keeping it in place and neutralizing them while the world around me vanishes, leaving behind an empty, barren, and glowing white wasteland with just me and the stranger left.  
  
My eyes glow with fury, the same fire that's present on my arm also resides on my ears and on the tip of my tail, completely altering my appearance as the strength continues to pulse through my body, fully aware that there are no other people nor structures that can eavesdrop on me and this stranger.  
  
After what feels like forever, my strength already dissipates, my grip gradually loosening up and leaving the stranger before me gasping for air. The fire in my eyes and arms vanishes as calmness behind to flow through my body, followed by a blend of confusion, fear, but determination to figure out what exactly is going on. *"I-I'm so terribly sorry! I had no idea! I was afraid, got overly cautious, and now.."* I stumble helplessly, emotions rushing through my body upon seeing the slight burn mark left on their throat. My ears flop down on my head in pure despair as the stranger before me regains their breath, and manages to find their voice. **"Quite the scare, it was."** They say politely and calmly, coughing to free up their airways before continuing. **"It's Marten, Junior Temple Guardian. It may look bad, but worry not, I've gone through worse Signatures and I'm still here to tell those tales."**

Without any effort, Marten stood back upright as the white dome surrounding us gradually begins to dissipate, the sound of the wind and the rustling of the leaves and flowers slowly returning. Frantically looking around me, I see the trees return, the whiteness disappearing while the gentle green reappears. **"You've made yourself a gorgeous mask"**, Marten suddenly says, eyeing the mask held in my left hand, breaking the gentle silence once more. Caught off guard, I reply flustered, not really having an idea of what to say. *"I-I barely use it.. Vászi said I recovered well enough to no longer need it.."*. With a gentle smile, Marten replies as he buttons up his coat, which hadn't even dawned upon me yet. He was wearing his usual attire, a luxurious brown coat covering up his otherwise regular clothing. If he aspired to be a Guardian, shouldn't he be wearing Guardian attire..?

### What's next?
For **EXPOSURE // SNOW** I really want Snow to reflect on her new life and overcome her deeply rooted fears. Dying one day and waking up the next day in a completely different body, headspace, and situation isn't easy for anyone. To reflect both sides of her personality, the rooted fears but desire to overcome those, the two Signatures, *Whiteout* and *Channelling Astárout*, help visualize those two sides. 

As for Marten, I'd like him to gradually grow into a non-characteristic Guardian. He has all needed skills and the right desire to become a Guardian, but much like Luna, really dislikes their formal attire, and thus chooses to wear his own. In his journey, I'd like to help him guide a new ghost through Rebirth together with Vászi, but I'll still need to come up with a proper story for this, since I don't want to make it too barebones!

### Home in the Forests
*// POV: Winter* \
It's been a while since that strange day in the Morrésik woods, where I was revived and reborn into the place and time I find myself in now. Marten had led me to his home, which he shared with Snow, and had since treated me as if I'd been family from the very first second onwards. I've frequently been in contact with Sóvis and Marten respectively, both aiding me and teaching me the ropes in my new life, the new world and culture I was put into, and both said they were very impressed with how quickly I managed to get the hang of everything. Apparently, most ghosts in my situation would go through a series of traumas from their past lives, or struggle immensely to adapt, but I didn't experience any of that myself. It worries me, and makes me feel like something is fundamentally wrong with me or missing, but I've also been feeling at peace with it. I can't combat any of this, because I have no choice but to believe that I did in fact go through rebirth, but even if so, things seem fine, so that makes me feel fine.

Wrapping my scarf around my neck, I slowly exit our home, making my way past the various markets and community meeting points on the way towards the Váseim. Despite the fact that I got myself killed in the Morrésik woods in my past life, I still felt deeply at peace in the forests, still getting the same thrill and peace of mine whenever I find myself within it. The Váseim was big as well, and even though I originally lived close to it, I never got to walk through it and experience it as much as I do now. It was still winter, meaning that the floor was coated with a generous blanket of snow, a place and time I always found myself most comfortable in. 

But despite the feeling of comfort and peace within the forests, I still felt uneasy at times as well. Other ghosts frequently mention how they quickly lose their old life's memories upon rebirth, and while some did vanish for me, other thoughts refused to disappear. Sitting down on the bark of a fallen tree, I take a few moments to get back to my thoughts. Even though it's been well over two weeks since, I still get vivid memories of that day, where I walked through Morrésik with the others, only to suddenly feel and see the floor sink away beneath me, hearing their voices yell for me, knowing how helpless they must've felt in a situation like that.. 

Snapping out of my focus, as the echoes of their voices are quickly exchanged for the quiet crunch of steps on snow, I frantically look around me, expecting an animal to walk around near me, but eagerly hoping to see my friends. My ears perk up, looking for every sound coming from every direction as my eyes follow soon afterwards. But my hope is short-lived, as I ultimately find nothing, shrugging it off as the rustling of a tree. I make my way back to the tree and sit back down with tears gradually building up in my eyes. More and more memories began reappearing in my mind, every happy memory, every sad memory, every single memory that I had ever made in my life was replaying again and again before me, as I watched the first teardrop fall on the blanket of snow beneath my feet, followed by many, many more. It felt like torture, it felt like hell. Even if my soul was deemed pure enough to be granted another chance at life, it didn't feel right. I missed them, more than I ever imagined I could miss something. Their laughs, their voices, hobbies, everything about them was perfect, and I had to ultimately come to peace with that I'd never be able to do the same things with them ever again.

But in a moment of peace, I suddenly stand back upright within the blink of an eye, sniffing quietly and feeling my tears disappear as my instincts takes over. I feel and see the wind pick up, circling around me and picking up snow along the way, creating a dome of snow and fog as my ears stand back upright, scanning around frantically to pick up where the strange sound that I heard originated from. With a swift step, I feel a mixture of a warm and cold rush seep through my veins as I turn around, my hand stretched out to confront the noisy creature that was behind my back. \
But as soon as I turn around, the storm that formed around me immediately comes to a stop as the snow slowly and quietly falls, my arm staying in the same position, my entire body freezing up upon seeing who was behind me. \
*"S-snow..! I-I didn't.. expect you here.."* \
**"I-I-I'm sorry..!"** She instantly replied, as I noticed how her ears flopped down and her tail puffed up, realising she was just as surprised and startled as I was. **"I-I'm sorry for scaring you..!! I just wanted to check up on you.."** \
With a quiet smile, I feel the extra strength in my body disappear as quickly as it appeared, causing me to slowly stumble forward into her arms. Even if it was momentarily, I felt like my entire body collapsed and lost all of its strength from channelling that storm, wondering just where I learned that, where I had gained that strength to begin with. 

After a minute or two, we both sit down on the same tree, my body still completely exhausted while Snow rests her hand on my thigh for support. Giving me another few seconds, she suddenly breaks the silence, explaining what had just happened, and how similar it was to how she first met Marten. I learned that the sudden strength and snowstorm were referred to as "Signatures", and how her signatures were very similar to mine. I managed to channel extra strength, which she can do as well, but most interesting of all, we both had an encapsulating signature. She brought up how I summoned a snowstorm, trapping her within, and how she can summon a similar dome, trapping in just herself or whoever she wishes.

Another moment of silence passes after Snow finished explaining everything, after which we went through all the memories we still knew, and all sorts of hobbies she picked up since her own rebirth and everyone she had met in the Temple ever since. Watching the sun gradually set, I guide Snow to one of the prettier spots within the Váseim, where the forest reached its edge and the sun would shine in all its glory, slowly sinking away behind the horizon, paving the way for the moon, as more memories of before my death came back. But instead of an icy chill, a pleasant warmth washed over my body this time around, as I took Snow's hand, holding it dearly, making sure I won't ever be able to lose her the way I lost Anita, Markus, and everyone else. *"I used to love watching the sun rise and set when I still travelled with my friends.."* I said quietly, my eyes fixated on the last ring of the sun gradually disappearing behind the horizon, seeing Alkéisa's Ring hovering just above it. I feel Snow holding my hand more tightly as a response, her head slowly turning towards me with a warm smile on her face. 

**"It might not be the same as back then, Winter, but we'll make many more memories together as well, I promise."** 

With more tears building up in my eyes, I look back to snow in disbelief. Having felt ready to abandon everything now that I felt like I had lost everything, my ears perked straight up as Snow continued to speak to me. I could see tears dwell up in her eyes too, glimmering in the light of the sunset and on the verge of streaming down her cheeks like mine.

**"We don't share similar characteristics, I'm a fox, you're a leopard.."** Snow slowly begins to whisper, her grip tightening around my back, **"I was raised in Keustellet, you were born in Karlsborg, but even despite all of those differences, you're like a sister to me, Winter.."** 

My heart was pounding, the tears broke free and I instinctively leapt forward with my arms wide, holding dearly onto Snow and letting out my tears, letting actions speak where words failed. My body began warming up, and the wind began to pick up, slowly but surely engulfing us in the same snowstorm that appeared when Snow first approached me. Before long, I felt Snow's arms wrap back around my back while the last bit of light from the sun disappeared with the sunset, handing the realm to Jerrát and its moonlight. 

**"It's all going to end up fine"** I heard Snow whisper to me after minutes had passed, and I slowly moved my face back out of her shoulder, feeling like I'd cried my heart out. 

**"As long as we stick together, forever."**



*// Below is the original tail snippet, that has been reworked into what is now implemented into the story. This will be kept for proofreading, and is subject to be removed*
With more tears building up in my eyes, I look back to Snow, instinctively leaning forward and giving her a tight hug, making sure to never let go of her in whatever situation or state I'll ever find myself in. As the tears begin streaming down my cheeks while the sun completely sets, Snow's arms carefully and gently wrap around my back, granting me the comfort and feeling of safety that I needed while the orange glow of the sun begins to fade away as well as the evening begins to set in. 

**"We don't share similar characteristics, I'm a fox, you're a leopard.."** Snow slowly begins to whisper, her grip tightening around my back, **"I was raised in Keustellet, you were born in Karlsborg, but even despite all of those differences, you're like a sister to me, Winter.."** 

With a quiet sniff, I feel the wind begin to pick up around us again, the snowy fog gradually returning as our vision reduces, encapsulating the both of us in the white dome within a snowstorm that I trapped Snow in earlier. Slowly feeling my body warm up, I hug Snow as tightly as I can, doing my best to keep my tears at bay, before whispering quietly, knowing that I'll be safe wherever I go with her and Marten. 

*"Thank you.. Snow.. for letting me be your sister.."*

### What's next? 
For **EXPOSURE // WINTER**, I've honestly already reached the end of what I intended to write about Winter adapting to her new situation within the *Temple of Vestia*. She has bonded both with Marten as a Guardian, and Snow as a sister, and from here on I will probably include Winter in other various stories together with Snow, considering the two are almost inseparable now. \
Over time, I'd like her to further develop her *Signatures*, but especially pick up various hobbies for her to kill time as wel, whether that is alone, or together with Marten and Snow. During this, she will gradually open up, as she originally had a very closed-off and bold personality that gradually loosens up over time as she gets introduced to new people within the Temple.
