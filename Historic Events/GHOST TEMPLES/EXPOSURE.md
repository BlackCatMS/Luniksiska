### Drafted Story
**// Subject to tweaks**: Originally, I wanted Luna to be unaware of the Ghost Temples existing as a whole, especially being unaware that there was an underlying connection. After the creation of *REBIRTH // SNOW*, this approach changed, and drastically changed the timescales as well. Because of this, several tweaks need to be put through the currently drafted story so that it becomes more in line with *EXPOSURE // SNOW*. Tweaks might include:
- Revealing the mysterious girl is also a ghost.
- Adjusting time scales so that the story doesn't take place after "All those years"

Roaming through the vivid and bright streets of Matéiazhu, hidden behind a mask and seen by nobody, is a young ghost. They lost their lives in a shock derailment incident on their way home from Zhuehai to Benelux, in the first deadly rail incident since the opening of the planetary rail network, at least 30 years prior. Ever since, they've been stuck in Zhuehai, forever longing to go home, but instead needing to find comfort behind a mask, roaming through the streets, eyeing every passerby, some familiars, mostly strangers. With their head down, they reach behind a corner store, taking a seat on top of the garbage collector, their hand resting on their cheek as they stare into the busy street. Every single night has passed like this. Staring at the busy street, eager and desperate to join the masses, but just being invisible to everyone, hidden behind a mask.  \
*"Is everything alright? You look exhausted.."* a young voice suddenly sounds behind them. Shockingly, they turn around, now facing a girl of about 19 years old, gazing deeply into their eyes. Completely taken aback by the situation, they stare back, their voice long gone as the girl gradually grows impatient. *"I don't have all day, I can help if you want me to"*.  \
Struggling to find the right words, knowing they last spoke a word all those years ago on the train, they lift their hand, pointing at the girl. **"You can.. see me?**" They ask, a raspy, distinct, yet slightly digitalized voice coming from behind the mask. In response, the girl nods, her already low amount of fear and doubt dropping to the floor as she draws closer, analysing the ghost's mask. *"You have a mesmerizing mask, it's so delicate.. Is it handmade?"* She tenderly asks, making clear she means no harm in the slightest.  \
**"It's.. old.. but made by myself."** The ghost mutters back, slowly regaining their long lost comfort in speaking, as they loosen up as well, gradually gaining trust in this mysterious girl before him. "I must know", they start, as they slowly drop down from the garbage collector, **"How are you able to see me? You are the first in years, this should be impossible."**  \
Instead of directly answering the question, the curious girl continues to overanalyse the ghost's mask, eager to point out smaller details, finding a crescent moon mark, the emblem of Vestia, and the symbol of Jérrat, beautifully integrated into the mask's white and gold colourway. Suddenly, she breaks the now minute-long silence, carefully looking into their eyes. *"It's strange. I've seen you around more often, as well as other masked people. I thought everyone systematically ignored you, but if I'm alone in being able to see you..-"*  \
The ghost suddenly interrupts, with their hand on their chest, gripping tightly on their suit. **"I've seen other ghosts. An Ox's mask, a Fox's mask, oddest of all, a broken mask of a Deer. If you've seen them too, it must be a sign. It must mean something."**  \
Nodding slowly, the girl's confidence seems to stagger as her eyes now face the floor, eyeing the ghost's shoes, but not in detail. Speaking softly, she gradually looks back up to face the ghost's mask. *"I've been meaning to ask, but if I may, what is your name?"*  \
A shiver runs through the ghost's phantom body, as flashbacks suddenly race through their mind. A vision of the train, a vision of family, all sorts of familiar faces, familiar places, seemingly so far away, as words and names refuse to formulate and connect. Raising their hand to their face, they once more struggle to collect words, before finally looking back into the girls eyes, responding confidently and clearly.  \
**"I am the Ghost of Luna. For now, that is all that matters."**

### What's next?
For **EXPOSURE // LUNA**, the main approach is following the Ghost of Luna through their story and describe their experience as a ghost, starting from the very moment of the rail incident in Zhuehai, all the way towards the complete connection of temples spread throughout the planet, maybe even hinting at temples located back at Earth?

- Mysterious man: **Guardian Marten**
- Temple name: Temple of Vestia

This is a very bold and rough draft because I struggle to properly put it to words and have it flow nicely into an actual story. Nevertheless, this is exciting to me because it showcases one of Snow's personal strengths, rather than her weaknesses.  

### Drafted Story
*POV: Ghost of Snow*  \
It's been a few weeks ever since. Day in, day out, I met with Vászi at the temple. We'd go through the different halls, the different divisions and wings that were underground, hidden away from other sources of life, except for the occasional group of deer that showed up in our forest. But it hasn't been too long, I've learned to adapt, I've learned to live with what I have now, even after death. 

Today, Vászi gave me a day to rest and recover, so I chose to spend that time at the edge of the forest with a grand view over the flower fields. Knowing that I'd have this view, I brought my mask and a brush, as the hours slowly began to pass as I began to gradually add colour to the mask, watching the sun gradually pass from noon to dusk while my ears continuously and frantically scan around, picking up all sorts of sounds from the nature surrounding me. From the birds flying through and out of the treetops, the wind gently shaking up the leaves, and the soft rustle from the waving flower field before me.

Suddenly, the peaceful sound of nature is broken as I hear a series of footsteps and cracking leaves approach me, their sound getting louder and louder with each step as my ears perk upright, facing to what's behind me, tracing the sound. My heart begins to pound in my chest, as I decide to stay put. *"Surely I'm imagining things, no?"* I ask myself, every single possibility rushing through my mind as I try to crack the code as to who might be stepping towards me. Do they know I'm here? Have then seen me? *Can* they see me?  
  
The footsteps quiet down, having stopped right behind my back, the stranger's warmth radiating against my tail as I do my best to keep myself upright and cautious, still having no idea what might happen next, before hearing one last step taken forward. From pure instinct, I felt like the stranger was reaching their hand out to touch me. In the blink of an eye, I turn around, my right hand coated in a blue, waving fire as I reach for the stranger's neck, keeping it in place and neutralizing them while the world around me vanishes, leaving behind an empty, barren, and glowing white wasteland with just me and the stranger left.  
  
My eyes glow with fury, the same fire that's present on my arm also resides on my ears and on the tip of my tail, completely altering my appearance as the strength continues to pulse through my body, fully aware that there are no other people nor structures that can eavesdrop on me and this stranger.  
  
After what feels like forever, my strength already dissipates, my grip gradually loosening up and leaving the stranger before me gasping for air. The fire in my eyes and arms vanishes as calmness behind to flow through my body, followed by a blend of confusion, fear, but determination to figure out what exactly is going on. *"I-I'm so terribly sorry! I had no idea! I was afraid, got overly cautious, and now.."* I stumble helplessly, emotions rushing through my body upon seeing the slight burn mark left on their throat. My ears flop down on my head in pure despair as the stranger before me regains their breath, and manages to find their voice. **"Quite the scare, it was."** They say politely and calmly, coughing to free up their airways before continuing. **"It's Marten, Junior Temple Guardian. It may look bad, but worry not, I've gone through worse Signatures and I'm still here to tell those tales."**

Without any effort, Marten stood back upright as the white dome surrounding us gradually begins to dissipate, the sound of the wind and the rustling of the leaves and flowers slowly returning. Frantically looking around me, I see the trees return, the whiteness disappearing while the gentle green reappears. **"You've made yourself a gorgeous mask"**, Marten suddenly says, eyeing the mask held in my left hand, breaking the gentle silence once more. Caught off guard, I reply flustered, not really having an idea of what to say. *"I-I barely use it.. Vászi said I recovered well enough to no longer need it.."*. With a gentle smile, Marten replies as he buttons up his coat, which hadn't even dawned upon me yet. He was wearing his usual attire, a luxurious brown coat covering up his otherwise regular clothing. If he aspired to be a Guardian, shouldn't he be wearing Guardian attire..?

### What's next?
For **EXPOSURE // SNOW** I really want Snow to reflect on her new life and overcome her deeply rooted fears. Dying one day and waking up the next day in a completely different body, headspace, and situation isn't easy for anyone. To reflect both sides of her personality, the rooted fears but desire to overcome those, the two Signatures, *Whiteout* and *Channelling Astárout*, help visualize those two sides. 

As for Marten, I'd like him to gradually grow into a non-characteristic Guardian. He has all needed skills and the right desire to become a Guardian, but much like Luna, really dislikes their formal attire, and thus chooses to wear his own. In his journey, I'd like to help him guide a new ghost through Rebirth together with Vászi, but I'll still need to come up with a proper story for this, since I don't want to make it too barebones! 


## // WINTER

Reserved for the expansion on the drafted story:

*Almost immediately after her Rebirth, Winter immediately understood the new world she found herself in, and adapted to it as if it was her second nature. Her Exposure will be where she meets **Snow**, soon after her rebirth, since **Marten** brings her along for shelter and care. Upon meeting Snow, the two immediately get along and immediately seem like twins, which is how Winter integrates into the Temple of Vestia right away.*
