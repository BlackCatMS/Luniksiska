# GHOST TEMPLES
**Location**: Spread out throughout the entire planet of Luniks (With a planned expansion on Earth)

The **Ghost Temples** are located throughout the planet in various desolate places, such as old forests, empty grass fields, or hidden right in the heart of a blooming temples. Unbeknownst to the masses of people on Luniks, the ghosts themselves find their home in these temples.

Observed by the sun *Choreos*, guarded by the moon *Jerrát*, the Temples find themselves on an **elevated plane of existence**. Commonly understood is that the Ghost Temples are an **"Elevated Realm"**, while the world below — the everyday life on Luniks — is the **"Lower Realm"**. This means that any changes that happen on Luniks, are mirrored into the elevated realm where the Ghost Temples find themselves in, but any Temples that are settled, and any homes that are built, do not reflect to the lower realm. 

The **Ghost of Cziskvelén** was the first Ghost to set foot in this Elevated Realm after his death on the Lower Realm. During his rebirth, it was explained to him by the **Higher Spirit**, the **Eye of Chroma**, that he now possessed a power to guide many more people that lost their lives in the Lower Realm upwards to the Elevated Realm, to continue their lives "as normal", and to grant them a chance to continue their lives after having them taken from them too soon in life. 


## The Lifecycle
Every ghost has gone through three stages upon introduction to their new Temple. These are:
- **LAST LIGHT** // The event that led to their death in their original life.
	- **LAST LIGHTS** are available at [[LAST LIGHT]].
- **REBIRTH** // The process in which a Guardian rescues and restores the spirit of someone that has gone through *Last Light*.
	- **REBIRTHS** are available at [[REBIRTH]].
- **EXPOSURE** // The event in which everything clicks together. Every memory that was able to be restored from the rescued spirit has been restored, and the new Ghost has now been permanently connected to their corresponding Temple. 
	- **EXPOSURES** are available at [[EXPOSURE]].

*// The cycle below is events that happen during the end of a lifetime for a ghost. However, said cycle is still on the drawing board and might end up being excluded altogether*

- ***DESPAIR** // The stage in which the quality of life of the Ghost or Temple is rapidly declining and in danger of running out.* // The **DESPAIR** entry is currently used in *DESPAIR // VÁSZI*, carrying a different meaning.
	- **DESPAIR // VÁSZI**, which uses the alternative meaning for **DESPAIR**, is available at [[DESPAIR]].
- ***TRAGEDY** // The event in which the Temple falls, or in which the ghost simply dies and vanishes, leaving behind just their mask.*

## A Quick Rundown
The current focus lays on the **Temple of Vestia**, where a small group of characters is actively being developed and have sprung to life. This list of characters is still rapidly growing, but is available at [[List of notable people#GHOST TEMPLES // VESTIA (2023)]], as well as under its corresponding header in the current page. 

Each Temple has a **Settler**, which reflects in the symbol that is created upon the foundation of the temple, and will forever be stored as a *plaque* within the *Memorial Hall*. Within this Hall, all sprits of present and past ghosts are available, as well as basic information regarding the temple and its symbols. The symbols are properly explained at [[Scattered Info#Known Symbols]].

Every **Ghost** has a unique set of abilities and powers that they either acquired through experience in their new realm, or were carried over during *Rebirth*. These abilities are referred to as [[SIGNATURES]], and require a varying amount of *Spiritual Energy* before they can be activated. 

A **Settler** possesses a tremendously high amount of *Spiritual Energy*, the same energy that forms around a Guardian's Signature *Guarding Light*. In order to become a **Settler** and settle your own Temple, *Guardianship* is a requirement, which is why many Ghosts choose to go through Guardian Apprenticeship, in order to gain the required knowledge, but also the required skills and power, to settle a Temple close to their birthplace, or place of death. 

**Cziskvelén** and **Vászi** are the Settlers of the *Temple of Vestia*. It's widely believed that **Cziskvelén** was granted his Guardianship by a higher, unknown power, which he himself referred to as *"The Higher Spirit"*, and passed this knowledge onto Vászi before settling the *Temple of Vestia*. However, as the *Temple of Zhuehai* is much older, there is also a legend that **Cziskvelén** is the *Higher Spirit* himself, and has since guided Settlers like **Guǎnzhù**, **Matéis**, and **Yun Li** to settle their own Temples first, before disappearing after the *Temple of Álusken* was settled.


## A Brief Timeline
### First Light
**First Light** is the most commonly used term to describe the legend of *Cziskvelén*, as he is widely renowned for being the first Ghost to have settled a Temple, the **Temple of Chroma**. Many years after his rebirth into a ghost, he settles the **Temple of Zhuehai** together with *Yun Li*, which is widely believed to be the oldest Temple still standing and still active to this day.
### Era of Vászi & Matéis
Together with *Cziskvelén*, *Vászi* settles the **Temple of Vestia** and *Matéis* settles the **Temple of Álusken**, where they both stay as Temple Guardians respectively as Cziskvelén departs into the unknown, disappearing for many years to come.
### Marten's Guardianship 
As the focus lays on the **Temple of Vestia**, *Marten* is reborn into a ghost, maintaining his original name from before his death. During this time, *Sóvis* joins the Guardianship, while *Átem* instead leaves, and *Luna* and *Snow* are reborn under this Temple.
### Era of Marten & Sóvis
Many months later, *Marten* and *Sóvis* near the end of their Guardianship, while *Vászi* begins to prepare for his departure from the **Temple of Vestia** for a final time, after *Matéis* had picked up a signal from *Cziskvelén*, far beyond the Morrésik mountains. Haphazardly, Marten and Sóvis are promoted to **Temple Guardians** at the help of Matéis, and sooner or later begin getting the hang of being a Tempel Guardian. During this era, *Raine* and *Winter* are reborn under this Temple.
