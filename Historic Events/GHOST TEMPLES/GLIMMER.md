# GLIMMER
Within Ghost Temples, a **Glimmer** is understood simply as a memorable moment that occurred at one point in a Ghost's life. These may be considered as everyday activities, such as *forest walks* for Winter, *painting* for Snow, and so forth. This document will capture all these various glimmers of the various Ghosts, and give a glimpse of their new lives.

## // SPARK
### You only live twice
**Drafted**: \
We follow a conversation between Winter(?) and Spark, who is a fairly new ghost, reborn by Sóvis. She has wavy, but messy brown hair with streams of pink and blue, and in this Glimmer she's spotted by Winter(?) to have picked up smoking. The two strike up a conversation, and Spark explains that she picked up smoking "out of curiousity", and was told by Sóvis that it can't harm her the way it did before her death. \
*"They always said "You only live once", but the two of us can prove otherwise. I felt like giving it a try."*

Speaking of her death, she reveals that she is still frequently haunted by her memories, and that her death "wasn't the most peaceful one". Winter(?) asks how she still remembers her old life so well, as Spark continues to go over more of her memories that had remained, and how she had discussed it with Marten too, who also kept the majority of his memories. Is there a connection to guardianship and lack of amnesia?
