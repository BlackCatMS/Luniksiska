# GLIMMER
Within Ghost Temples, a **Glimmer** is understood simply as a memorable moment that occurred at one point in a Ghost's life. These may be considered as everyday activities, such as *forest walks* for Winter, *painting* for Snow, and so forth. This document will capture all these various glimmers of the various Ghosts, and give a glimpse of their new lives.
