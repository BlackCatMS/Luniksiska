# GLIMMER
Within Ghost Temples, a **Glimmer** is understood simply as a memorable moment that occurred at one point in a Ghost's life. These may be considered as everyday activities, such as *forest walks* for Winter, *painting* for Snow, and so forth. This document will capture all these various glimmers of the various Ghosts, and give a glimpse of their new lives.

### You only live twice
**Drafted**: \
We follow a conversation between Winter(?) and Spark, who is a fairly new ghost, reborn by Sóvis. She has wavy, but messy brown hair with streams of pink and blue, and in this Glimmer she's spotted by Winter(?) to have picked up smoking. The two strike up a conversation, and Spark explains that she picked up smoking "out of curiousity", and was told by Sóvis that it can't harm her the way it did before her death. \
**"They always said "You only live once", but the two of us can prove otherwise. I felt like giving it a try."**

Speaking of her death, she reveals that she is still frequently haunted by her memories, and that her death "wasn't the most peaceful one". Winter(?) asks how she still remembers her old life so well, as Spark continues to go over more of her memories that had remained, and how she had discussed it with Marten too, who also kept the majority of his memories. Is there a connection to guardianship and lack of amnesia?

**"That Spark is gone, Winter! I didn't need a second chance. It's even more hopeless than before. I wish I could just forget."**  \
Taking another puff of her cigarette, her head sank to the ground, staring at the floor beneath her feet, the hopeless feeling getting ever so terrible as tears began to stream down her cheeks once more, wet drops landing on the dry tiles.  \
**"I had no chance. Their helpless faces. His bloody knife."**  \
The feeling of the knife in her shoulder overwhelmed her again, as she clutches it in reflex, the sensations and emotions going way overboard.  \
**"It's unfair! I just want to forget, I want to forget! Why can't I forget?! Why do I have to relive it every single day?!"**  \
Without Spark realising, Winter had kneeled down before her, her arms spread wide open, inviting her in for a tight hug.

Spark had returned home with great news: She had gotten news from her guitar teacher that she could do auditions at a professional studio and maybe earn a trial place in a proper college. She ran home, surprised to see the lights still on at home (it was 11pm, her parents and older brother are usually asleep at this time).

The lights were still on, I could see it through the windows. Did they hear the news already? Maybe they even made a little surprise for me! With full excitement, I unlocked the front door.  \
**"I'm hoooo-"**  \
Before I could even finish, I already knew something was terribly off the second I stepped through the door. *Blood on the walls. Murky smell. Distant flame. No response. Noise upstairs*.  \
**"-meee.."**  \
I frantically looked around, my heart sinking to the floor and beating in my throat simultaneously. Blood.. walls.. noise upstairs..  \
**"H-Hello? Mom?"**  \
I dropped my guitar on the floor, a hollow feeling overwhelming me and fear rushing through my veins as I hesitantly take more steps forward.  \
**"Dad? Bryan? W-what's going on?"** \
The nasty snell of fire and blood refused to go away, and with quiet and hesitant steps I made my way towards the stairwell that led to our bedrooms and the bathroom. *The burning smell is getting closer..* was the only thought going through my head, a trail of blood seeped down the stairs, dripping on every next step downwards.
