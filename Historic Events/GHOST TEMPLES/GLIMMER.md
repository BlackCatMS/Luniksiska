# GLIMMER
Within Ghost Temples, a **Glimmer** is understood simply as a memorable moment that occurred at one point in a Ghost's life. These may be considered as everyday activities, such as *forest walks* for Winter, *painting* for Snow, and so forth. This document will capture all these various glimmers of the various Ghosts, and give a glimpse of their new lives.

## // SPARK
### You only live twice
*// Note: This draft is currently being juggled between being an Exposure entry and a Glimmer. This means that the final location for this story might change.*

**Drafted**: \
We follow a conversation between Winter(?) and Spark, who is a fairly new ghost, reborn by Sóvis. She has wavy, but messy brown hair with streams of pink and blue, and in this Glimmer she's spotted by Winter(?) to have picked up smoking. The two strike up a conversation, and Spark explains that she picked up smoking "out of curiousity", and was told by Sóvis that it can't harm her the way it did before her death. \
**"They always said "You only live once", but the two of us can prove otherwise. I felt like giving it a try."**

Speaking of her death, she reveals that she is still frequently haunted by her memories, and that her death "wasn't the most peaceful one". Winter(?) asks how she still remembers her old life so well, as Spark continues to go over more of her memories that had remained, and how she had discussed it with Marten too, who also kept the majority of his memories. Is there a connection to guardianship and lack of amnesia?

**"That Spark is gone, Winter! I didn't need a second chance. It's even more hopeless than before. I wish I could just forget."**  \
Taking another puff of her cigarette, her head sank to face the ground, staring at the floor beneath her feet, the hopeless feeling getting ever so terrible as tears began to stream down her cheeks once more, wet drops landing on the dry tiles.  \
**"I had no chance. Their helpless faces.. his bloody knife.."**  \
The feeling of the knife in her shoulder overwhelmed her again, as she clutches it in reflex, the sensations and emotions going way overboard.  \
**"It's unfair! I just want to forget, I want to forget! Why can't I forget?! Why do I have to relive it every single day?!"**  \
Without Spark realising, Winter had kneeled down before her, her arms spread wide open, inviting her in for a tight hug.
