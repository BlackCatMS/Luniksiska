# GHOST TEMPLES // REBIRTH

**Rebirth** refers to the rebirth of those that died in accidents of no fault of their own, and were granted another chance to live through the process of rebirth, granted by a Temple Guardian. In standard cases, Temple Guardians choose the most pure souls that were robbed of the proper, long life that they deserved and died too soon in an accident or circumstance they had no control over. This includes accidents like the **2074 Matéiazhu Rail Disaster**, and the **2075 Keustellet missile strike**, where *Luna* and *Snow* lost their lives, respectively. 

Upon rebirth, a newly born Ghost is introduced to their new Guardian, that will introduce them to their new life and explain in a light amount of detail what had happened to them in their past one. As all Ghosts struggle with amnesia, where all memories but the Last Light rapidly vanish upon rebirth, this means it will both be easy yet hard for them to adapt to their new lives.

### Unplanned Stop
*POV: Luna*

*"The deafening sounds of everything collapsing had passed, I felt like I lost the ability to hear, to see, to feel. Had I died? What happened? I remember the train, the derailing, the crash. I must have died, haven't I?..."* \
**"As painful as it is to say, yes, you have."** \
Dumbfounded to hear a reply at all, I try to reopen my eyes, struggling to gain focus of the figure before me, or focus on anything at all. My ears began to ring again as the visions of the moments just before the train derailment begin to replay in my mind, before gradually burning up and vanishing as soon as they appear. The figure before me was vibrant white. A black and white mantle, a snow white mask, wearing a hood, so curious...  \
Before long, I finally manage to focus my eyesight again as the figure before me becomes clearer, much like the scene surrounding them. Everything seemed familiar, I recognized the different platforms, I recognized the ceiling and the unique lights that hung around here at this time of the year. Until suddenly it clicked, and I looked to my left. My eyes opening wide, everything immediately flashed back to me. I didn't just find myself in Matéiazhu, nor just at the train station. It was far worse. I found myself at the scene of the accident, with the fateful train right beside me. In shock, I turn back to the figure before me, struggling to keep my emotions under control as everything begins to fall apart in my mind. \
*"W-what's going on?"* \
**"Beside you is a VR20, or what's left of it. You had boarded this train, with good faith, but a power failure led to this accident, and the loss of your pure life."** \
"Pure life?" This was too much to handle for me. Even though I used to excel in strange and supernatural conditions, this was outrageous. This was way beyond anything I could ever have imagined. I started to grow more annoyed. I needed to know where I was, I needed to understand what happened and what will happen next, but as I tried to stand up, I was interrupted once more by the white-masked man before me.
**"Do not exert yourself. I am here to help. As sudden as this might be, I am here to help"**
He reached out his hand to me, showing no signs of hostility whatsoever, as I was conflicted in my emotions yet again.

### Despite Everything
*POV: Snow* \
I woke up with immense soreness and icy chills spread throughout my body. It felt out of place, it felt wrong, but I couldn't lay a finger on just what it was. The vivid memories of the explosion, Daniel screaming for help, the numbness, wetness, and immense pain I felt just now, what had happened to that? I opened my eyes slowly, a layer of dust on the floor beneath me, a lingering cloud of dust filling up the rest of the aisles, the single rays of light from the hole in the roof providing the only light in the entire market. My head continued to throb, blood rushing through my veins as it slowly but surely awoke again. Just where was I? Had I been rescued after all? Did Daniel make it in time with calling 992, did I merely pass out? \
In shock, I look around to find clues, my memories appearing in snippets, one after the other at the speed of light. I saw Daniel, the bottle of Vodka he was holding, my worries about Carbine, until the bang right above me. I felt the pressure from the roof collapsing on top of me once more, the emotions that Daniel and I were going through replaying over and over again, tears streaming down my cheeks now knowing that that was behind me. I was buried under the pile of rubble, waiting for my inevitable death. \
My memories began to burn away, the pictures that my mind was presenting me grew holes, erasing the memory entirely. My head began to hurt, my mind began to hurt, a feeling of disconnect from reality overwhelming me as I try to stand up. I held onto the shelves, realising the pile of rubble was to my left, without a body underneath. It failed to make sense to me, my memories began to fail me, my body began to fail me, I couldn't adjust, it all became too much. The pictures in my mind faded away, gone with the wind, lost to the kindling fire that reached into every corner in my head. \
I couldn't understand. My legs were crushed, how could I walk? Daniel held my hand, where was he now? The entire supermarket was abandoned, just how long had it been? How did I.. survive? Had I survived, at all? The memories completely faded, my head left empty, my body shifted, and as quickly as I remembered, I began to forget.

Groaning softly, I fall back to the floor and move my hand to my forehead, feeling it throb as blood surges through my body as I gradually come to be. A vision repeatedly pulses through my mind, an image of a formally dressed, masked man, black shirt, white robe, a mask completely covering his face, white.. \
**"It appears you have awoken, young ghost."** \
A voice booms through the supermarket, echoing off every wall as I turn my head upwards, facing the strange figure that I just pictured in my mind right before me. Millions of questions come to me right away, but none exit my mouth as I only manage to let out a soft gasp, feeling like I'm unable to speak, as if I'm silenced by the strange aura emitted by the figure before me. \
**"Speaking is not advised. It appears you have died."** He says without emotion. Through his mask, I can feel his eyes stare deeply into mine, my body shivering as I now feel completely helpless, completely lost. Feeling tears already begin to build up as every emotion rushes through my mind, from fear to confusion, to anger and sadness, he opens his robe, and reveals a mask. \
**"This will help you speak. Please understand and put it on."** \
Carefully taking the mask from his hand, I study it deeply. A plain, white mask with fox characteristics, especially with its enormous tipped ears. Gulping as I wipe the tears I tried to hide away, I put on the mask, feeling a new stream of energy and warmth instantly stream through my body as I reopen my eyes, gazing upwards at the mysterious figure before me, trying to scramble together the right words. \
*"What's.. going on?"* \
**"I am the Settler of Vászi. Your name is Snow. Together, we are part of the Temple of Vestia. I understand this is a lot of information to take in at once, for that, I'm sorry"** \
Finishing his words, Vászi carefully bows in an apologetic manner, his robe delicately wrapping around him in a protective manner, almost as if it's a defensive manoeuvre. In response, I crawl upwards, my legs continuing to wobble, now fully aware of the situation I, and my body, are in, while more and more information seeps into my mind from the mask. Catching my breath and readying my words, I prepare myself for the worst of answers. \
*"Vászi, if I may ask, what.. happened?"* \
Without hesitation, the Settler takes a step forward to put a hand on my shoulder, his other hand revealing a copy of an ID card, and flips it around, revealing a small mirror, which in turn reveals my face, mismatching the pictured face on the ID card, as I feel a cold shiver run through my body upon realisation. \
**"On October 4th, 2075, a missile struck the supermarket you find yourself in. You happened to be in the wrong place, at the wrong time, and were trapped right beneath where the roof collapsed. We were not able to rescue your body, but we rescued your soul, and gave you another chance in the body that matches your soul."** \
A chill runs through my spine, and an everlasting moment of silence begins between us. My body had felt odd from the very second I had reawakened, and the glimpse I got of myself in the mirror fully explained why. Moving my hands to my face, I carefully take off the mask, feeling a cold breeze enter my lungs as I take a deep breath, struggling to keep my head high, to keep my emotions beside me for the time being. After what feels like hours, I finally find the strength to stand up, as I stare before me, Vászi's arm extended, feeling his eyes gaze deeply at mine through his mask once more, but feeling a much more inviting, a much more pleasant warmth this time around. Taking his hand, I try to speak, but get cut short, still struggling to speak without wearing my mask, and being interrupted by Vászi. \
**I'm terribly sorry that you had lost your previous life, and I understand your new form is vastly different. I will make a promise: I will guide you, and I will guard you, for I am your Guardian from now on.**

### A New Trail
*POV: Winter* \
With a loud thud, I suddenly jumped back to my senses, even if everything felt off and wrong. I felt oddly energetic, yet sore all over, and especially nauseated. It felt like I was hit by a truck, on the highway which was carrying nothing but dense metals at high speed, my body hurt more than I had ever felt before and I couldn't place a finger on why that was the case. With a loud cough, I feel my head begin to pulse in pain too, before all of a sudden, all the soreness and pain vanish into nothingness. Struggling to fight through the new numbness in my body and mind, I gradually lean upwards and open my eyes, expecting to see total darkness after the fall, but instead finding myself buried in snow, right next to the ravine I thought I had fallen into. Now realising what was going on, I desperately look around, trying to find a glimpse of Anita, or Markus, or anyone that witnessed me fall. Did they somehow manage to pull me out of the ravine, but then abandon me? *"If they did.. how did I.. survive?"* I thought to myself, panic rushing through my veins as I desperately look around, needing to find an answer, needing to find where the others were, so I could tell them that a miracle had happened, that I had survived the fall. But instead of finding the others, my eyes landed on two mysterious figures before me, turning my panic into worry.

**"Unfortunately, your fall was fatal. You did not survive."** 

Upon hearing his voice, my worry became fear. My mind short-circuited, and I struggled to find a reasonable explanation as to why these people were standing before me. They weren't my friends, they wouldn't be waving me farewell before I would go to heaven. No matter how much I tried, I couldn't find a reason, I couldn't understand what was going on. This all seemed too real, and yet, so.. unreal.. what was going on?

*"What.. what happened..?"* I mutter under my breath, my voice sounding hollow and raspy, as if I had awoken from a bad sleep on top of the Kálisgerou, I struggled to breathe, to think, to do anything in the state I was in right now. \
But without a second thought, I looked upwards again, the icy chill that took a hold on my body slowly vanished, as I saw that the man before me had held his hand out to me. Taking his hand immediately, I got lifted upright, in awe at how he managed to pull me up that effortlessly, as I eagerly listened to his voice again. 

**"I'm sorry if this is a sudden shift, Winter. My name is Marten, beside me is Sóvis. From today on, we'll be your guardians."**

After a few seconds of wobbling, I find my proper footing again, having a sense of normality again ‒ as far as normality goes ‒ and continue to hold his hand tightly. It seemed like an immense burst of information at once, and yet, I felt very understanding and complacent with what was going on. By now I had realised that my body had shifted, the feeling of a tail dangling behind me was obvious at this point, and I know that my ears weren't in their usual place either, and even despite all of that, everything already felt natural. 

Before long I saw Marten take off his mask, revealing his slight beard, while Sóvis kept his mask on, paving the way and escorting us as we slowly began to move forward again, away form the ravine, towards my new home. Hesitating just slightly, I held Marten's hand tightly, looking him deeply into the eyes and feeling a sense of comfort and confidence, as I asked him gently. *"Marten, what happened.. before.. this..?"*

Without a single bit of hesitation, he immediately replied, holding my hand tightly in return as he began to explain. **"It's a lot to take in, I'm sorry. The simplest way to say this, is that you had died, and we have revived you into your current state. The three of us, along with many others, are all part of the Temple of Vestia, a commune of ghosts that have all gone through the same situation you're in right now. We rescue ghosts, just like you, when they're taken from their previous lives too soon."** \
Nodding carefully, I felt understanding, and especially grateful that I was given such a chance to start anew, even if it meant saying farewell to my friends. \
*"How come my body is so.. different.. though? I don't remember much.. but.."* \
**"We're never able to rescue a person's body, but only their soul. In some cases, your soul doesn't exactly match the body you lived your past life in, just like yours."**

I nodded again, the cold and icy feelings finally disappearing, trading places with warmer, comforted feelings. A sense of belonging, a sense of being cared for. Something I didn't miss in my previous life, but something I didn't expect to feel again either. 

*"Thank you.. Marten, for all of this.."* \
**"I should be thanking you instead, Winter, for your good heart. Let's continue on home, now, you deserve to rest after all of this."**


## // MARTEN  
**Drafted:** \
Just like a normal day in his hospital bed, Marten would wake up expecting nothing, even though his entire world had just changed. He finds himself in his hospital bed, oddly enough without any pain at all. He remembers his name, his situation, and all that had happened, and his memories don't fade either.  
- He steps out of bed in awe, stretching and moving like he hadn't been able to do, before deciding to step out of hospital room, wondering why it's do quiet in the otherwise busy and lively hospital  
- Instead, upon stepping out, Vászi stands at the end of the hallway, who then explains Marten's situation and guides him through his rebirth

### Freed From Pain
*// POV: Marten*


## // SPARK
**Drafted**: \
Soon after her death, her father had left the house for what it was and drove off into the sunset, leaving behind a mystery crime that left Spark and her family dead. \
Spark reawakens at the bottom of the stairwell where blood had dripped down from not even an hour ago, facing the front door with the guitar she had dropped besides it. Oddly enough, the pain in her chest from the blade her father had stabbed and killed her with persisted, while the pain in her shoulder had gradually receded again. Sóvis, who was at the top of the stairwell, realised this too, wondering if he was too soon to initiate the Rebirth.

Sóvis holds his hand out, Spark's violin in the other, and offers her to climb up the stairs. Weirdly enough to Spark, she didn't have the same odd feeling as she had before her death, even despite the walls still being soaked in dry blood. Together, they make their way to the various bedrooms, and Sóvis reveals to Spark that she had indeed been killed by her father. The spirits of Bryan and her mother appear too, and she is able to give them a proper farewell one last time. (**Leaves open Rebirths for both -> Hopeless Glimmer into a happy one where her family is reborn too?**) 

### The Flame Reignited
*// POV: Spark* \
A wave of dizziness washed over me, and I felt like I was awakening from a month-long slumber, I felt disoriented, lost, but surprisingly enough, everything smelled familiar, like home. \
Slowly, I opened my eyes, my vision blurry at first, but after a few blinks and seconds it became clear to me just where I was: home. *Or at least, as close to home as I could be.* I thought to myself. I looked around the living room, I saw the front door as I realised that I had been fast asleep while on the stairs. The dizziness persisted, and the smell of dried blood became more prominent as well, especially upon taking a look to my knees. The stream of blood from Bryan's body that dripped down the stairs formed a puddle at the end of the stairs, which had transformed the light wooden floor into a dark, crimson gate to hell.

I shivered, the pain in my shoulder remained there. But after pressing on it with my hand, and checking for blood, I looked back at my hand to see nothing at all. The pain persisted, but the wound was gone, and frantically checking my chest, not finding any ripped clothes or wounds there either. *B-but.. Dad's knife..* I whisper to myself, the images and memories replaying in my mind over and over again, feeling the blade slam against my shoulder, through my chest, again, again. 

Fighting through the pain, I decided to force myself to stand up, to figure out what was going on. A strange mist was forming within the living room, the temperature was dropping further as I stood up from the stairs, eyeing the dried blood on the walls, the floor, and on my guitar at the front door. 

**"Please, do not be afraid, Spark."** 

I stand dead in my tracks, a deep, booming voice suddenly interrupting the silence within my ravaged house. *"Spark?"* I thought to myself, ticked off at being addressed like that. *Only mom called me her sparkle, w-what.. is going on..?* \
Hesitantly and slowly, I turn around and look up the stairs to discover who the voice had belonged to, only to be met with a confronting image. An otherworldly figure stood before me, dressed in white, wearing a plain mask, a pitch black chestplate. Dried blood, ripped wallpaper behind him, and yet, his mantle and mask were the brightest shade of white I'd ever seen in my life. I knew one thing for sure, this wasn't dad, nor was it a joke from Bryan or Kimi either. This figure was.. strange.. yet oddly familiar.

*"W-what? Who are you?"*

The figure before me opened out his right hand, his body language giving off no harmful intentions at all, as he promptly replied in the same, oddly comforting voice. \
**"My name is Sóvis, the Guardian of the Temple of Vestia. I know that this is tough and mysterious, but allow me to help you and guide you through this."** \
I felt my breath become more unstable as I tried my best to formulate my next words. The dizziness that had faded slowly made its return, together with the flashbacks and memories of the night before. The knife appeared before my eyes, my thoughts entered overdrive. *I died, haven't I?* I thought to myself, the pain of my dad's blade piercing through my chest making itself present yet again. *B-But, what's this.. then?* \
I collapse to the floor, the pain in my left shoulder and my chest causing my entire body to collapse on itself, my left arm returning to the numbness I had felt right after I was hit, right before my mom died in my arms. I heard Sóvis's footsteps come closer, he was coming down the stairs. Having lost sense of what was going on, I tried to cover myself up, my arm covering the top of my head while tears streamed down my cheeks once more, fearing the worst, fearing I would just get killed again.

But with emotions running overtime once more, the footsteps stop, and the creaking of the stairs immediately made it clear to me that Sóvis sat down. I felt his cold, gentle hand rest on my arm, slowly moving towards my right shoulder and resting it there as he whispered quietly and carefully to me. \
**"Whatever you're seeing, Spark, it's behind you. I promise you it will and cannot happen again."** \

### A Voice Who Called
*POV: Raine* \
With a deep sigh, I picked the jar of pasta sauce from the cabinet in the supermarket. I personally despised making myself pasta, but with guests coming over, I had to please the guests as well, knowing that Michael surely wouldn't mind me going outside of my comfort box with dinner. A few steps northbound, I headed to the meat section of the store, taking a simple box of ground beef, betting on having some left over beef to treat myself and Michael with something special, just for the two of us. From the thought alone, my cheeks turn into a deep red, imagining all the things I could make, the smile on his face as he would take his first bite, oh, how romantical!

But it wasn't until I reached the last aisle that I started to realise things were off. Taking a wine bottle off the shelf as the cherry on the cake, I saw something off in the centre of my eye. Colours were starting to get more muted, the noise of the crowd within the supermarket began to fade out. The combined noise of every customer chatting in a casual, friendly way with the others, began to rapidly fade into the same sound. 

*"Is what you see real?"* I suddenly heard a voice say right behind me, causing me to nearly drop the bottle of wine I was holding out of pure fear. With a gulp, I turn around, ready for the worst, but ultimately seeing, nothing? The voices started to echo around me, from every direction, as I quickly placed the bottle back on the shelf. *"Are you paying attention?"* I felt my heard pounding in my chest, fear reaching levels I never knew it could reach. *"Do not be afraid"*, the voices began to whisper. *"Your help is here."* I began to frantically look around, trying to find out if this was an elaborate prank being pulled on me. *"Czu onan visés?"* Trying to speak, to yell out, I find my voice lost from the sheer amount of fear and anxiety rushing through my veins, as the voices start to repeat the same thing, again and again. *"Fear not, Raine."*

My eyes fixate on the main entrance of the small supermarket, right behind the checkout section, where a cloaked figure had appeared. My fear reached even higher levels than before, the strange figure gradually making their way towards me, showing no intent of stopping, but weirdly enough, no intent of harm either. The colours began to fade completely, until every colour became a mixture of greyscale and muted, dark colours. White fog began to fill the supermarket, sending chills through my body, before realising it was beginning to rain. I suddenly heard the steps of the figure before me, his appearance becoming more clear to me, even despite the lack of colour. But that didn't matter, they were wearing a black harness, a bright, white mantle, and a creepy, plain white mask. Before realising it would be impossible to rain inside a supermarket, the steps stopped, as the figure stood still, reaching their hand out, and breaking the silence.

**"Please, do not be afraid. I am here to guide you through this, Raine."**

With the lump still well and present high up in my throat, I do my best to swallow it away, failing in the process. Keeping myself from coughing violently, I take a deep breath, and finally decide to reach out my hand towards the creepy white figure before me, managing to spurt out a few words as I gently hold his hand, as careful as I can be. \
*"Y-you.. won't kill me.. right..?"* \
**"I'm afraid we're already past that stage. This will be your revival."**

An ice cold breeze immediately rushed throughout the supermarket, the rain becoming even colder, with his words echoing through the aisles and walls. "Past that stage"? Just what was this guy on? Every single thought dashed across and through my head. Had I died? When? How? Just what happened? Is this a joke, was this an out of season prank? I had a bad relationship with the neighbours two doors down, but this would be out of this world, even for them! \
Doing my absolute best to keep my tears at bay, keeping myself from panicking or collapsing under my fears, I whisper under my breath, my eyes tracing down from the luminescent mask, down to his pitch-black harness. \
*"W-what..?"*

Without hesitation the figure before me replies, and begins to explain. His tone of voice stayed the same; Cold and otherwise emotionless, but oddly warm, as if he really intended to help me through this. As he began to speak, I tried to go through every memory I had made in my life, but struggling to properly picture them before me. The first kiss with Michael, meeting his parents for the first time, all the way to our honeymoon, but as I envisioned every memory, I quickly began to realise that that would be my last ever time seeing those memories. The colours began to mute and grey out, before the pictures themselves began to burn away, holes forming, before the entire memory would be burned away from my mind, lost in the infinite sea of thoughts.

**"There is no easy way for me to say this, Raine. You had just been assassinated, wrongly. You looked identical to a Mafia target. The shooter had misjudged."** \
*"S-so.. now..?"* \
**"It means you were killed wrongly, and it wouldn't be right for us to let your life go to waste like this."** 

With a quick, but careful motion, he takes his left hand and slowly presses it on his mask. Within a second, the mask lets go, as he brings it down, revealing his face to me, a warm, inviting smile having been kept hidden behind the mask, nestled within a ruffled beard. The rain in the supermarket quickly came to a stop, the white mist that had formed slowly began to dissipate, as I felt a strange, and especially mysterious ray of warmth encompass me while tears began to stream down my cheeks. A mixture of hope and grief rushing through my blood. 

**"My name is Sóvis, the Guardian of the Temple of Vestia. I'd like to guide you through this sudden change, Raine, you are deserving of this second life."**
