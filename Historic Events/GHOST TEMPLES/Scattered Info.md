# GHOST TEMPLES - Scattered Info

## Known Temples
### Temple of Vestia
Settled together by Cziskvelén and Vászi, the *Temple of Vestia* is where the main focus lays within the story of **Ghost Temples**. Located deep within the The Vászi Nature reserve, within the forest separating Zhuehai from Álusken, is where the majority of Ghosts that are present within the story will reside in.
- **Present Symbols:** Water, Choreos, Zeta, Aries, Cziskvelén, Jérrat, Phereos
- **Guardian**: Settler of Vászi
### Temple of Álusken
The Temple of Álusken was the last temple to be settled by *Cziskvelén*, before his disappearance and beginning of his Legacy. Together with Matéis, who remains the present Settler and Guardian, this temple was settled deeper within the nation of Álusken, bordering the capital city Álusken. It's widely believed that the Temple has a direct relation to [[Álusken's Mysteries]].
- **Present Symbols**: Earth, Choreos, Rho, Pisces, Cziskvelén, Luna
- **Guardian**: Settler Matéis
### Temple of Zhuehai
The Temple of Zhuehai is the oldest temple to still be active, having been settled by *Yun Li* way before the other temples, such as Vestia and Álusken, were discovered. This also means that the temple still maintains the **original styles**, which have quickly phased out as new temples sprung up and others were left vacant.
- **Present Symbols**: Earth, Choreos, Alpha, Aries, Guɑ̌nzhù, Depheos
- **Guardian**: Settler Yun Li
### Temple of Sórskist
The Temple of Sórskist is another unique temple, as it's located deep within the waters away from the *Harbour of Sórskist*. This makes the temple harder to reach and harder to find, but more easily for the various representative ghosts to reach, even despite the pressure from the water.
- **Present Symbols**: Water, Choreos, Gamma, Gemini, Águn, Luna
- **Guardian**: Settler of Thórirssée
### Temple of Girréiapolou
Going against other design standards set by the other temples on Vestia, the Temple of Girréiapolou maintains a more Greek-inspired building standard. This makes it blend in with the architecture spread throughout Hédenis, as aside from being more recognizable within the city, it's also one of the first temples that wasn't kept secret from the public.
- **Present Symbols**: Water, Sol, Pi, Gemini, Stéiffansik, Luna
- **Guardian**: Settler Stéiffansik
