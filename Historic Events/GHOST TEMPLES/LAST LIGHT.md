# GHOST TEMPLES // LAST LIGHT

**Last Light** refers to the last light the existing ghosts saw before dying and being reborn. This means that every entry into this page will document the very last moments of their previous identities. Such as Luna lost their lives on the fatal Vestia Rapid incident, and Snow lost her life through being at the wrong place at the wrong time, all that they have in common is that they were granted a next change and were granted shelter in the Ghost Temples.

Before entering the Temple, they are approached by a Guardian of the respective Temple, which gives them the capabilities and strength to undergo the process of rebirth. This is always traditionally done at the same location of the accident, that unfortunately cost them their lives. The location is completely devoided of any other humans or animals, and a white mist will linger around the Guardian and the soon-to-be Ghost.

## // LUNA
Vestia Rapid is a conventional high-speed rail service connecting the various nations of Vestia, being capable of reaching service speeds up to 400 km/h and connecting the different capitals without sacrificing extra budget for a line that exclusively supports Maglev trains, something that remains dominant in Asia. In 2040, the new train lines had undergone intensive testing and the trains were finally allowed to enter service in 2044, and continued to service the line without any major incidents. \
That is, until **August 30th, 2074**. Entering regularly scheduled service from Álusken to Benelux, passing through Zhuehai, is a Vestia Rapid VR20. Boarding in Zhuehai is the Ghost of Luna — then known as *Storm* — a non-binary young adult who was out with his friends in Shánzhe, before waving them goodbye early to board the approaching VR20. \
Upon boarding in Shánzhe, the train was scheduled to pass through Matéiazhu and the Danish exclave of Karlsborg, before reaching their home country of the Benelux. Usually, this means the service should cross the border about 45 minutes after departure.

20 minutes after departure from Shánzhe, the blooming and glowing city of Matéiazhu draws closer, as the train gradually begins slowing down from its rapid cruising speed. To Storm's surprise, this happens with much more rumbling than usual, as the train begins shaking and veering from left to right, up to a point where the cabin lights begin flickering as the battery begins to struggle to keep up with the low power draw from the OHLE. As Matéiazhu quickly comes within the 5km range, Storm begins to understand what's going on. Gazing out the windows, they see similar buildings fly by at a much higher speed than usual. By this time, they should be going a mere 200 km/h already, but the out-of-control VR20 is still flying past them at 350 km/h. Panic ensues in the coach, as other passengers begin to hoard their baggage or brace in their seats, grasping for non-existent seatbelts, as the city draws nearer and nearer, without any sign of slowing down, the only signs passed being those that signal **"Danger"**.

24 minutes after departure, the high-speed rail section reaches its **end**, indicating a maximum possible speed of 160 km/h, while the approaching train is still racing at 320km/h. Arriving from the central section, the VR20 is due to board at platform 15, all the way in the south end of the train station. Upon the first junction, Storm feels the entire train begin to tilt and fall over as the first set of bogies detach, followed by the second pair, before the entire train **derails**. Grabbing onto their seat, fearing the worst, the impact of the train on its side knocks them out of their seat as it continues to slide towards platforms 7-8, before inevitably, the lights go out.


## // SNOW

Reserved for an expansion on the snippet from [[REBIRTH#// SNOW]]:

***"On October 4th, 2075, a missile struck the market you find yourself in. At the same time, criminals entered through the North and South sides to plunder and raid the market. Ever since, it has been left vacant. We were not able to rescue your body, but we rescued your soul, and gave you another chance in the body that matches your soul."***


## // WINTER

Reserved for an expansion on the drafted story:

*Winter travelled together with a group of friends through the woods of Morrésik, having planned this journey for many years and finally deciding on taking it this winter. During this trip, they set up camp in various spots and cityhop along the way, and after passing the village of **Myradsked**, they cross the border of **Mónsan** into the wilds. Winter eventually lost her life as she fell into a ravine that was covered up by snow, and was given another chance at life by **Marten** due to her **"pure, healthy, and kind soul"**.*

*// POV: Winter*
With a deep breath, I sit upright in the tent, hearing Martin still snore beside me while the sleeping bag to my left was already empty, meaning Anita had already left the tent to go for her morning walk. Putting on my joggers and hoodie, I carefully and quietly unzip the door of the tent, seeing how it's still fairly dark outside; It's barely dawn, but I do still see bright beams of light on the horizon, and a dark sky slowly turning orange. Right outside the tent was Anita, having plopped down in a folding chair, making herself a simple tea over the induction heater, as she suddenly hears and spots me crawling out of the tent. *"Oh, Julia! I hadn't heard you wake up, good morning!"* She cheerfully whispered to me, making sure to not wake the others still sleeping in the tents up. *"Had a bit of a pleasant sleep in the Mónsan Mountains?"* \
With my hands rubbing my face to wake myself up, I groggily nodded, still feeling very drowsy from how late we all went to sleep last night, how long it had taken us to even reach this open spot deep into the forest. But despite this spot being temporary, it sure was a sight to see the sun rise like this. **"I slept pretty terrible,"** I whispered back to Anita, feeling how raspy my voice was, worried that I was already developing a cold, but shrugging it off as a morning voice. **"But it sure was worth this view."** 

Plopping down in the folding chair next to her, we watch the sunrise together with a cup of hot tea to warm us up, before our attention is diverted to our left, as more rustling comes out of the tents. Waking up in unison were the remaining three, as Martin exited our tent, and Lisa and Markus promptly exited the other tent, all looking equally groggy as the two of us did. *"Been a rough night for you three, hasn't it?"* Anita joked in an attempt to uplift the spirits of everyone, as she immediately gets a reaction out of Markus, leading to a little bit of morning banter between the five of us. 

Finishing my tea and watching the sunrise for a little longer, I finally decide to head back into my tent, gradually beginning to pack everything again, as the last section of our journey was crossing the border just outside of Myradsked, where we would head into the Morrésik Mountains and finish our journey there. We collectively decided to make the journey as lightweight and as easy on us as possible, not bringing too much items with us and getting food whenever we would pass a town, but after Myradsked, that would no longer be an option, and would also become the toughest section of our journey yet. But with the five of us and high spirits, we all knew that we would make it through just fine.

Before long, we collapsed the tents and made our way past Myradsked, as we trotted deeper and deeper into the vast mountains and woods of Morrésik. Many legends about these woods and mountains would frequently be passed from generation to generation, about how neither Mónsan nor Álusken ever decided to claim the mountains, or to settle here, because of many reports of supernatural activity. And even though I've not been a kid for many years now, those legends and tales did begin to cycle through my mind, as I began to feel increasingly worried, beginning to hear and see things that startled me, the rustling of leaves, the sound of deer or moose in the far distance, all lead to my steps becoming more uneasy. 

*"You feeling alright?"* Markus suddenly asked me, startling me further as I felt myself jump for a second, before realising what had just happened. I nodded slowly, mumbling back to him with the worries still lingering in the back of my mind. **"Could be worse, could be better.. It's the folklore legends that are beginning to worry me.."** \
With a gentle laugh and smile, he patted me on the shoulder as I looked up to him, his antlers sticking out like a sore thumb to me still, even though he's had them for several years now since his visit to Kérisant. *"I get your feelings, but you don't need to worry, they're all just legends, after all."* He said back to me, giving me just enough sense of hope that I began to feel warmed up again, ready to tackle whatever lays before us. 

But the sense of warmth and hope was short-lived, as none of us realised what was ahead of us. Anita and Martin were quick to notice, that there was a steady gap in the trees, and they quickly made their pauses and scanned around for another route, something that neither me nor Markus had done. And within the blink of an eye, I felt Markus's hand leave my shoulder, the snow beneath me giving way to my weight. Without being given a second to process what just happened, I fall forwards, downwards, into the ravine that was hidden right beneath us. The snow had covered it completely, the roots of the trees creating a white, cozy blanket of snow, that couldn't stand the weight of any of us. 

*"Julia!!"* I hear from the distance, Anita's voice quickly fading away into an echo that bounces off the walls of the ravine, as I fall further and further, with no end in sight. In the span of a second, I felt every memory and every thought I've had in my life cross my mind, making the fall last forever. And yet, within that very second, the ravine reaches it end, and inevitably, the lights go out.
