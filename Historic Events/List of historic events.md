# Historic Events

Considering the rapid discovery and rapid colonisation of the exoplanet, now known as Lúniks, some dates need to be moved back in time, meaning this becomes a complete alternate universe that diverges from our existing one at around 1980. 

### 1994 
Prior to accelerated development in acquiring knowledge about space, planet, starts, and galaxies, the hunt for intergalactic colonialism begins, not long after colonialism ends on Earth. One thing remains certain: Whereas there were many conflicts on Earth in the previous centuries regarding colonies, colonising an exoplanet would be a feat as one body, going beyond nationality, races and religion.

In 1994, exoplanet Lúniks is discovered within the Messier 45-system, which was discovered a year prior. 

### 2005
After years of development written above, the first series of freight ships depart to Luniks. Monstly carrying basic materials and tools to make Luniks self-sufficient from the very start, these ships should be the foundation of Luniks. 


### First wave of the Luniksan revolution (2005-2026)
Described in [[Cities per Nation]] under Kérisant-civem, the first wave of the Luniksan revolution was the first wave in which cities and smaller villages bloomed and were built as quick as possible. Once a decent portion of humanity moved to Luniks and its newly-built cities, the wave reached an end and the excessive construction slowed down. The second wave occured soon after, in approx. 2032, and saw more creative and futuristic design languages and architecture take shape. The original and initial wave of construction that shaped the first cities of Luniks remained, giving cities a core center with older architecture, similarly to the majority of Europe.

### Second wave of the Luniksan revolution (2032-2044)
The second wave of Luniksan revolution was mostly aimed at building more sustainably, while also creating much more homes and places of comfort for the ever-growing planet of Luniks. Cities doubled in size almost every year, which meant the planet needed rapid action, but also rapid construction. This second wave of Luniksan building caused a spike in architecture, as function was paired with form, creating a set of futuristic but desolate spaces with enormous appartment complexes and towers in the second ring of cities. This revolution slowed down again in around 2040, as the influx of new inhabitants also decreased.
