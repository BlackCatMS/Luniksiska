Considering the rapid discovery and rapid colonisation of the exoplanet, now known as Lúniks, some dates need to be moved back in time, meaning this becomes a complete alternate universe that diverges from our existing one at around 1980. 

### 1994 
Prior to accelerated development in acquiring knowledge about space, planet, starts, and galaxies, the hunt for intergalactic colonialism begins, not long after colonialism ends on Earth. One thing remains certain: Whereas there were many conflicts on Earth in the previous centuries regarding colonies, colonising an exoplanet would be a feat as one body, going beyond nationality, races and religion.

In 1994, exoplanet Lúniks is discovered within the Messier 45-system, which was discovered a year prior.
