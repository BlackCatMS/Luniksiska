### 12-02-00 - Discovery of life and change of approach
**To**: internal@eesa.eu, willemsenfd@eesa.eu \
**Sender**: lesenenaa@fsa.fi \
**Subject**: Flora and Fauna on Lúniks  
  
Frank,  
  
Earlier today, we've received a signal back home in the Lappland observatory from probe ELL-1. Together with simple atmospheric measurements, she snapped a few pictures and took a ground and air sample too, and the results have surprised everyone here. We've already determined that the gravity is approximately 9.60m/s2, which can be considered identical to that of Earth, but the flora and fauna images that were received are breathtaking. For good measure, I've attached them to this email.  
  
What you're looking at is the forest in the marked area where the city of Kastávje is meant to be built, and I had to blink twice to see whether they were real or not. You're looking at images that are taken in the forests of Lúniks, just to remind you. Isn't this incredible? It seems identical, it seems like a well-dressed central European forest. If you would have told me this is a forest in Slovakia, I think I would have believed you!  
  
I think it's worth taking another shot at iterating ELL-2, Frank, we're discovering an almost identical clone of our own planet before our eyes. This is an opportunity we cannot and shall not waste.  
  
I will see you in April,  
Alexis Lesenen.

### 14-05-01 - Proposal to allocate land on Vestia to Benelux and Denmark
**To**: internal@eesa.eu, internal@rijksoverheid.nl, information@folketing.dk \
**Sender**: lesenenaa@fsa.fi \
**Subject**: Allocation of land on Vestia to Benelux, Denmark

To all recipients,

Together with others at the Lappland Observatory, we have come to a conclusion that the allocation of land on the Vestia continent is going rather slowly, but has also hit a wall in regards to who is allowed what. We have already concluded that settlers from Taiwan and Greece will have areas designated towards them, as well as the currently unregulated and unspecified areas of Álusken and Mónsan, but more information regarding these should follow soon.

The topic that I would like to discuss with the combined governments of The Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg, as well as the Kingdom of Denmark, is a proposal to allocate land to the east of proposed Zhuehai (Taiwan). Attached are borders that are roughly drawn, and are already nearing completion, given that all parties come to agree with this proposal. 

We understand that the imminent danger of global sea level rise is causing major concern in both of your respective nations, which is precisely why this email is sent to you, the recipients. I am eager to hear your responses.

On behalf of the Lappland Observatory and the EESA,
Alexis Lesenen.

### 27-02-03 - Request from Bëndén to settle Mhárani
**To**: internal@eesa.eu, willemsenfd@eesa.eu, masegophi@eesa.eu\
**Sender**: lesenenaa@fsa.fi \
**Subject**: Bëndén's request to settle Mharáni Desert in Eastern Kérisant

To Frank and Petrus,

I've received an odd request from Kápan earlier today. In case he's no longer a familiar name to the both of you, the full name is Kápan Bëndén, and he has had interest in the Mharáni desert for about a year now. Despite the images from OTL-4 confirming time and time again that it's primarily a barren desert landscape, his requests persisted, so I have attached a proposal for drawn borders in this email that he may utilise in order to settle his piece of land after Starship 2 is set to land.

Personally, I think he is onto something that might be lying directly under our noses. Kápan has continuous access to OTL-4's feed as well, maybe he's spotting something that we haven't spotted ourselves at Lappland or the EESA just yet? This is food for thought, but with Petrus having returned to Geneva for the time being, I think this should be a topic for you two to handle.

Lappland continues its operations, has any signal gotten back from the stability of the Panjit Loop just yet? It's been a while since I've last heard back from Akájune, but I believe it's nothing to worry about, though.

Have a good evening,
Alexis Lesenen.

### 06-11-04 - Discovery of vital forests on Deónia
**To**: internal@eesa.eu, rosenqvistsp@fsa.fi \
**Sender**: lesenenaa@fsa.fi \
**Subject**: Discovery of vital forests on Deónia

Stefan,

I write this message to inform you about the findings of the OTL-5's probe regarding her research on Skádia and Deónia. As the both of us know, our main focus is plotting out the discovery and pining down the habitable areas on the remaining two continents, now that Ubunia and Vestia are already filled to the brim. However, I must halt you on this. I'll explain.

Last night, at 21:33, the team at Lappland discovered that Deónia of home to an enormous amount of vital forests at the equator, that are believed to have the same impact that the Amazon rainforests in South-America have to our own planet. We also are aware of the effects that it will have once these forests are interrupted. We don't know anything about the wildlife on Deónia nor Skádia either, because we have not iterated ELL-3 just yet, and this will probably be shelved while Starship One prepares for launch too. Our priorities are currently shifting towards preparing our settlement mission, too, which means that further data regarding the planet will be limited.

Therefore, I would like to request a full stop regarding settlement plans on Skádia and Deónia, and leave the proposals for Emyria and Náhrekv for what they are. We are about to embark on the greatest global mission since the beginning of humanity, and I would prefer we do not interrupt the planet as we do so. 

I will return to Geneva around June, until then,
Alexis Lesenen.
