### 24-08-78 - End of Cold War, development shift into rocket technology
**To**: 527 recipients \
**Sender**: internal@esa.eu \
**Subject**: Announcement: Development shift into rocket technologies \

To all recipients,

You are receiving this email, because the department you are working under will undergo a shift in development. 

As you are aware, the Cold War has ended, and threat of imminent nuclear war is now in the past. By all parties involved, a request was made to redirect the rocket technologies that were developed during the making of nuclear warheads and intercontinental missiles into rockets and propulsion methods that can play an important role in bringing humanity back into space. It has already been 9 years since the Moon landing, but this will not stop us.

We have proposed a number of dates where we will hold a planar conference with all recipients of this email, to give you more information and details about what this will mean for your future activities under the ESA. Alternatively, a written availability sheet is also available at the reception desk in Geneva.

We hope to see you all soon at the planar conference, \
Prof. Meyeren for European Space Agency (ESA)

### 29-05-86 - Development shift into exoplanet research
**To**: 304 recipients \
**Sender**: internal@esa.eu \
**Subject**: Announcement: Development shift into exoplanet research

To all recipients,

You are receiving this email, because the department you are working under will undergo a shift in development.

With the activation of the Hubble Telescope last year, we have unlocked a key factor in researching and viewing the incredible beauty and mysteries about the solar system and universe we find ourselves in. This means that the departments you are currently working under (e.g. Solar Monitoring & Research, Mars Research, etc.), will be shifted towards discovering planets that find themselves in a similar place in space and time as planet Earth. 

Before his retirement, Prof. Meyeren's team believed that the rocket technologies that have been developed accelerated the speed at which research of space and the universe is proceeding at, and this shift in development will lead to something he firmly believes to be the "next step in humanity's legacy". 

As is usual with a development shift, an availability sheet is available at the reception desk in Geneva, and another email will follow in a few days regarding the planar conference that will be held in the Geneva exposition, later this summer. 

We hope to see you all soon at the planar conference, \
Prof. Van Haeghen for European Space Agency (ESA)

### 12-07-90 - Recruitment of Tagip Panjit
**To**: internal@esa.eu, masegophi@esa.eu
**Sender**: lesenenaa@fsa.fi
**Subject**: Transfer of Mr. Panjit from ISRO to ESA 

Petrus,

Earlier today I have returned to Lappland after a week of travel and talking with the research team at the ISRO in Bengaluru. Together, we spoke to one another and reached an agreement regarding their prodigy student, Tagip Panjit, who was on track to pick up the pieces that Einstein had left behind after his death. With the ISRO still unsure what direction it wanted to take, but already certain enough that it would be limited to satellite technologies and moon research, we agreed to transfer Mr. Panjit to the ESA, where he will continue his research together with the team in Geneva. 

Mr. Panjit will focus on developing his theories regarding his beliefs and theories regarding **wormholes**, and answering the question whether it's really possible to travel faster than light. The team at Lappland believes that we're at the doorstep of a major breakthrough in space travel, but in due time, an announcement from ESA should inform you and others about Mr. Panjit's findings. Until then, our eyes at the Lappland Observatory will continue to monitor Hubble and seek out solar systems in our galaxy, where humanity's journey might continue.

Until then, I hope to travel back to Geneva soon to catch up with you again, Petrus. \
Kind regards, \
Alexis Lesenen.

### 18-08-94 - Choreos-RP-4 is discovered, research shift
To: 174 recipients
Sender: internal@esa.eu
Subject: Announcement: Discovery of Choreos-RP-4, and the course following

To all recipients,

Earlier this week, the team in Geneva, under the lead of Jonathán Thórirsonn, have returned their eyes to Messier-45 and Choreos. In the process of scanning and analysing the planets that were in the habitable zone, Choreos-RP-4 was discovered and further analysed through the eyes of Hubble with supervision from Alexis Lesenen. Concluding this research, both teams have discovered that Choreos-RP-4 is the mostly likely planet to be our one-in-a-million shot in the dark at settling an exoplanet. In emails that will follow soon, more details as to why will be revealed.

Choreos is a mere 6 lightyears away from our solar system, and with rocket propulsion technologies having increased our travel speeds to near the speed of light, a mission would still take at least 6 years to send a probe for detailed research. However, we believe that Mr. Panjit is close to unlocking the keys to closing this distance to a mere hour. For this too, more information is to follow.

This announcement closes with information regarding all recipients of this email. You will soon receive another email regarding your new outpost, as the branch you are under will shift towards research regarding Choreos-RP-4. The remaining teams will proceed with their work for discovering other potential planets until further notice.

More information will follow, keep an eye out for your inbox. \

### 12-02-00 - Discovery of life and change of approach
**To**: internal@esa.eu, willemsenfd@esa.eu \
**Sender**: lesenenaa@fsa.fi \
**Subject**: Flora and Fauna on Lúniks  
  
Frank,  
  
Earlier today, we've received a signal back home in the Lappland observatory from probe ELL-1. Together with simple atmospheric measurements, she snapped a few pictures and took a ground and air sample too, and the results have surprised everyone here. We've already determined that the gravity is approximately 9.60m/s2, which can be considered identical to that of Earth, but the flora and fauna images that were received are breathtaking. For good measure, I've attached them to this email.  
  
What you're looking at is the forest in the marked area where the city of Kastávje is meant to be built, and I had to blink twice to see whether they were real or not. You're looking at images that are taken in the forests of Lúniks, just to remind you. Isn't this incredible? It seems identical, it seems like a well-dressed central European forest. If you would have told me this is a forest in Slovakia, I think I would have believed you!  
  
I think it's worth taking another shot at iterating ELL-2, Frank, we're discovering an almost identical clone of our own planet before our eyes. This is an opportunity we cannot and shall not waste.  
  
I will see you in April, \
Alexis Lesenen.

### 14-05-01 - Proposal to allocate land on Vestia to Benelux and Denmark
**To**: internal@esa.eu, internal@rijksoverheid.nl, information@folketing.dk \
**Sender**: lesenenaa@fsa.fi \
**Subject**: Allocation of land on Vestia to Benelux, Denmark

To all recipients,

Together with others at the Lappland Observatory, we have come to a conclusion that the allocation of land on the Vestia continent is going rather slowly, but has also hit a wall in regards to who is allowed what. We have already concluded that settlers from Taiwan and Greece will have areas designated towards them, as well as the currently unregulated and unspecified areas of Álusken and Mónsan, but more information regarding these should follow soon.

The topic that I would like to discuss with the combined governments of The Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg, as well as the Kingdom of Denmark, is a proposal to allocate land to the east of proposed Zhuehai (Taiwan). Attached are borders that are roughly drawn, and are already nearing completion, given that all parties come to agree with this proposal. 

We understand that the imminent danger of global sea level rise is causing major concern in both of your respective nations, which is precisely why this email is sent to you, the recipients. I am eager to hear your responses.

On behalf of the Lappland Observatory and the ESA, \
Alexis Lesenen.

### 27-02-03 - Request from Bëndén to settle Mhárani
**To**: internal@esa.eu, willemsenfd@esa.eu, masegophi@esa.eu\
**Sender**: lesenenaa@fsa.fi \
**Subject**: Bëndén's request to settle Mharáni Desert in Eastern Kérisant

To Frank and Petrus,

I've received an odd request from Kápan earlier today. In case he's no longer a familiar name to the both of you, the full name is Kápan Bëndén, and he has had interest in the Mharáni desert for about a year now. Despite the images from OTL-4 confirming time and time again that it's primarily a barren desert landscape, his requests persisted, so I have attached a proposal for drawn borders in this email that he may utilise in order to settle his piece of land after Starship 2 is set to land.

Personally, I think he is onto something that might be lying directly under our noses. Kápan has continuous access to OTL-4's feed as well, maybe he's spotting something that we haven't spotted ourselves at Lappland or the ESA just yet? This is food for thought, but with Petrus having returned to Geneva for the time being, I think this should be a topic for you two to handle.

Lappland continues its operations, has any signal gotten back from the stability of the Panjit Loop just yet? It's been a while since I've last heard back from Akájune, but I believe it's nothing to worry about, though.

Have a good evening, \
Alexis Lesenen.

### 06-11-04 - Discovery of vital forests on Deónia
**To**: internal@esa.eu, rosenqvistsp@fsa.fi \
**Sender**: lesenenaa@fsa.fi \
**Subject**: Discovery of vital forests on Deónia

Stefan,

I write this message to inform you about the findings of the OTL-5's probe regarding her research on Skádia and Deónia. As the both of us know, our main focus is plotting out the discovery and pining down the habitable areas on the remaining two continents, now that Ubunia and Vestia are already filled to the brim. However, I must halt you on this. I'll explain.

Last night, at 21:33, the team at Lappland discovered that Deónia of home to an enormous amount of vital forests at the equator, that are believed to have the same impact that the Amazon rainforests in South-America have to our own planet. We also are aware of the effects that it will have once these forests are interrupted. We don't know anything about the wildlife on Deónia nor Skádia either, because we have not iterated ELL-3 just yet, and this will probably be shelved while Starship One prepares for launch too. Our priorities are currently shifting towards preparing our settlement mission, too, which means that further data regarding the planet will be limited.

Therefore, I would like to request a full stop regarding settlement plans on Skádia and Deónia, and leave the proposals for Emyria and Náhrekv for what they are. We are about to embark on the greatest global mission since the beginning of humanity, and I would prefer we do not interrupt the planet as we do so. 

I will return to Geneva around June, until then, \
Alexis Lesenen.

### 12-02-05 - Green Light for exploration mission
**To**: internal@esa.eu, willemsenfd@esa.eu \
**Sender**: lesenenaa@fsa.fi \
**Subject**: Exploration mission around Nóve Réjkjavik is greenlit

Frank,

Earlier today I've received a confirmation from both head of command Augustin and from Aélu himself, that the fleet of two exploration ships to land and explore around the designated Nóve Réjkjavik area has been given the green light, to the dismay of Mr. Thórirsonn. I know that he has been eager to become the first man to set foot on Lúniks, but will simply not be possible. Having **One** become the first ship to land on Lúniks is an extreme risk, and we would like to test whether it is habitable in the first place. Therefore, Aélu has designed a fleet of smaller, capable and tested spaceships that adhere but iterated the Space Shuttle design, and have survived numerous jumps through the **Panjit Loop**, with ease. 

Please forward this to Jonathán, but give him the opportunity to go through intensive testing, if he wishes to be the first man to set foot on Lúniks. I will await your response, the flight date is currently set for April 15th. 

I hope to hear back from you soon, \
Alexis Lesenen.

### 13-02-05 - Jonathán agrees to training for exploration mission
**To**: internal@esa.eu, lesenenaa@fsa.fi \
**Sender**: willemsenfd@esa.eu \
**Subject**: Re: Exploration mission around Nóve Réjkjavik is greenlit

Alexis, 

I bring good news. I've forwarded your message to Jonathán, and despite his disappointment in learning that **One** is not the first ship to land on Lúniks, he was understanding and did agree to undergo training. It seems that nothing is holding him back from his dream to be the first man to set foot on the planet that he himself had discovered, and in all honesty, I can do nothing other than respect his wishes.

I've forwarded his request to the ESA training centre, Jonathán has already gone through various launches before and has a medium amount of training under his belt, and knows what to expect. Our priorities lay in teaching him the protocol ropes and having him go through the Loop once or twice in simulation to analyse the stress on his body. I believe this should go smoothly, though, meaning Aélu shouldn't expect any delays with the exploration mission.

This concludes all I had to say, have a good evening, \
Frank Willemsen
