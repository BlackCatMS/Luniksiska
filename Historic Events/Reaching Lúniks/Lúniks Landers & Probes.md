# Lúniks Landers & Probes
In the process of analysing and preparing Lúniks for settlement, various iterations of Landers and Probes were developed in order to gather information for safety and for preparation. This document serves as an informative document for all the various names the Landers and Probes carried throughout the discovery missions.

## Landers
Naming convention: **ELL-n**: **Exoplanet Lúniks Lander**.
### ELL-2
Iterating from **ELL-1**, **ELL-2** was launched and sent to explore the various flora and fauna in **marked Thórirsant**. Equipped with various equipment to analyse ground samples, air samples, as well as a camera and microphone, it would analyse the forests and determine whether or not there was life present on the planet where telescopes couldn't determine.
### ELL-6
Originally launched to further analyse the **Vaon auroras**, **ELL-6** was destroyed by a mysterious force of energy and lost connection with Geneva right away. In hopes to discover what caused its destruction and disconnection, **OTL-6** would keep its eyes on the mountains for the time being while time ticked by before the Vestian Allocation could take place. Once Vestia is allocated, it can be retrieved and the auroras can be explored properly from the ground up.
### ELL-9
**ELL-9** was deployed when Starship **Three** returned to Lúniks to mark the start of Vestian Allocation, and had the goal of researching and taking samples in the **Deónian Forest Reserve**, an area that was drawn out and closed off to preserve. With the forests having such a significant impact on the planet, ELL-9 was set to discover the reason why, as well as discovering new sorts of flora and fauna in the process.

## Probes
Naming convention: **OTL-n**: **Orbital Telescope (for) Lúniks**.
### OTL-4 
**OTL-4** is the most important **Orbital Telescope**, that has answered the last majority of questions regarding land and nature on the remaining continents. Where **OTL-2/3** kept their focus on **Ubunia** and **Vestia**, **OTL-4** instead focused on **Skádia** and **Deónia**, discovering the important forests and nature in the process, which put a halt to the rapidly growing settlement plans for the continents below the equator. 
### OTL-5 
Together with **OTL-4**, **OTL-5** kept its eyes and sensors on **Skádia** and **Deónia** in hopes to further analyse the forests on Deónia and its importance to the planet. 

## Wormhole Testers
### LNK-1
Carrying the abbreviated name of the planet **Lúniks**, **LNK-1** was the first small-form probe that was sent through the **Panjit Loop**, to put the forces that are applied during wormhole travel to the test. To everyone's surprise throughout the observatories in Europe, LNK-1 survived the jump through the wormhole and successfully returned a signal after arriving at Lúniks in **1996**, which meant that further research and settlement was no longer a dream.

## Settlement ships
### Starship Zero
**Starship Zero** is the name of the prototype ship that was built and tested thoroughly to see if the design and development by **Aélu Akájune** went smoothly. **Zero** was put through intensive stress testing and went through the **Panjit Loop** various times to test its sturdiness and build quality, and whether it would be able to withstand going through a wormhole in the first place.
### Starship One
**Starship One** is the first iteration of the enormous settlement ship that was due to carry a generous amount of people and materials through the **Panjit Loop**. This ship departed on **September 14th, 2005**, and landed in soon-to-be **Nóve Réjkjavik** a day after.
