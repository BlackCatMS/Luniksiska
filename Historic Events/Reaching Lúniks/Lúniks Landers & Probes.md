# Lúniks Landers & Probes
In the process of analysing and preparing Lúniks for settlement, various iterations of Landers and Probes were developed in order to gather information for safety and for preparation. This document serves as an informative document for all the various names the Landers and Probes carried throughout the discovery missions.

## Landers
Naming convention: **ELL-n**: **Exoplanet Lúniks Lander**.
### ELL-2
Iterating from **ELL-1**, **ELL-2** was launched and sent to explore the various flora and fauna in **marked Thórirsant**. Equipped with various equipment to analyse ground samples, air samples, as well as a camera and microphone, it would analyse the forests and determine whether or not there was life present on the planet where telescopes couldn't determine.

## Probes
Naming convention: **OTL-n**: **Orbital Telescope (for) Lúniks**.
### OTL-4 
**OTL-4** is the most important **Orbital Telescope**, that has answered the last majority of questions regarding land and nature on the remaining continents. Where **OTL-2/3** kept their focus on **Ubunia** and **Vestia**, **OTL-4** instead focused on **Skádia** and **Deónia**, discovering the important forests and nature in the process, which put a halt to the rapidly growing settlement plans for the continents below the equator. 

## Wormhole Testers
### LNK-1
Carrying the abbreviated name of the planet **Lúniks**, **LNK-1** was the first small-form probe that was sent through the **Panjit Loop**, to put the forces that are applied during wormhole travel to the test. To everyone's surprise throughout the observatories in Europe, LNK-1 survived the jump through the wormhole and successfully returned a signal after arriving at Lúniks in **1996**, which meant that further research and settlement was no longer a dream.

## Settlement ships
### Starship Zero
**Starship Zero** is the name of the prototype ship that was built and tested thoroughly to see if the design and development by **Aélu Akájune** went smoothly. **Zero** was put through intensive stress testing and went through the **Panjit Loop** various times to test its sturdiness and build quality, and whether it would be able to withstand going through a wormhole in the first place.
### Starship One
**Starship One** is the first iteration of the enormous settlement ship that was due to carry a generous amount of people and materials through the **Panjit Loop**. This ship departed on **September 14th, 2005**, and landed in soon-to-be **Nóve Réjkjavik** a day after.
