# Alkéisa's Ring
## 2024 note
*This document is due for a rewrite. The new data are that the Ring is being developed from 2025-2037, and deployed and activated in 2037. This is to make the Ring connect more properly to the development of Lúniks as a whole, which will connect to [[Reaching Lúniks]].*

### Status: Deployed; Active
The brainchild of Matéus Alkéisa, a planet-sized ring guarding the planet against space debris, creating and infusing the atmosphere with enough oxygen to create a stable atmosphere for life to bloom within, and to pressurise the planet to nearly identical levels to Earth. 

The first phase started way back in 2071, where Matéus completed his final sketches based off Elon Musk's Starlink program. Being fully aware that Luniks' two moons could easily be harvested for resources with then-modern techniques, Matéus was able to scale up the existing Starlink project by at least 25x, creating an almost impossibly large module system that would gradually be constructed over the following 15 years.

Phase two was completed in late 2086, where each constructed model was successfully launched and put into position in space. Each module would attach and connect to a sister model, looping around the entire planet and orbiting it similarly to the rings of Saturn, completely dependant and subject to gravity's forces. The last module snapped in place on November 14th, 2086, enabling phase three.

Phase three then required everything else to work as planned. Oxygen needed to be generated, pressure needed to be correctly applied and everything had to work exactly as intended, even against the vast forces of Luninks and space around it. But as intended, all tests completed without issue over the next months, and a controlled projectile was correctly averted fom the Ring's counter forces. The planet began blooming for the centuries to come as Alkéisa's Ring was now fully deployed.

#### Alkéisa's ring has been deployed successfully on August 05th, 2087
