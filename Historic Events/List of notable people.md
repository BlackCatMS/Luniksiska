# Notable People

## Oslo Revolution (2018 Draft)
### Lars Persson, Sergus Persson (Awaiting inclusion)
Both have led the revolution that took place in Oslo, Norway. However, since the direction and course of the Luniks project has been changed so often and so much, the Oslo revolution no longer fits within the timeline of Luniks. This means both people will either disappear within the story, or stay and become attached to a different story.    
### Ricky Reiut (Awaiting inclusion)
Described above, Reiut is also part of the Oslo revolution, or at least part of the organisation that led up to the revolution. The same applies to Reiut; The Oslo revolution no longer fits in line with Luniks, which means the character will be repurposed or removed.  
### Jonathán Þórirson
Often referred to as the "Settler of the next generation", or simply "Settler of Luniks", Þórirson (Also written as Thórirson), is known this way as he was the first man to set foot on this new planet and settled the first city on the planet as well, *Nóve Réjkjavik*.
### Tagip Panjit 
Panjit is of Indian descent and is the scientific wonder that enabled Earth to leap forward years in time with travelling to Luniks, creating and realising the technology needed to reduce the travel time from 74 years, to just 4.5 hours, with even further shortening options ready to be developed. 
Having studied in Oxford, Tagip came in close contact with the ESA and quickly researched and developed the technology needed to reach Luniks in such speed. 
### Seventh Léjtuse (Awaiting inclusion)
The Seventh Léjtuse is intended to be an insurgent army also involved in the Oslo revolution, but as described with Persson and Reiut above, this is put back to the concept board.

## Leremkov Trials (2022)
### Vitaly Leremkov
Leremkov's story is described in [[Vitaly Leremkov, 2039-2098]].
### Dénis Terczekv (Awaiting inclusion)
Of Kérisantic descent, but has no affiliation or purpose within the project just yet. A likely purpose for Terczekv will be the lockdown of Leremkov's labs within Kérisant.  
### Stacy & David 
From the drafted "victim story" in [[Story Drafts]]. \
As of yet, neither have a family name yet, nor a good bit of history. Their most basic identities are described in the above linked draft. Once more information surfaces on them, this part will be properly updated.
### Vienna Méckláz & Olen Rosenqvist
Vienna and Olen are described in detail in [[Leremkov Trials#Vienna & Olen]].

## GHOST TEMPLES // VESTIA (2023)

### Settler of Vászi
As the **Guardian of Vestia**, the *White/Grey* dress code is mandatory for a Guardian to wear. Because of this, Vászi wears a blacked-out and grey harness, over which he wears a robe or mantle, with a collar that extends far out.

Vászi bears a **Plain White Mask**. He prefers a featureless mask that hides his expressions and body language while guiding a new ghost through Rebirth. This way, he will give the new ghost the most neutral and natural way to process it all, without giving a first impression, be it good or bad, through an altered and personalized mask.

His name, *Settler of Vászi*, is derived from the area in which he had settled the *Temple of Vestia*, which is located between Álusken and Zhuehai, in a nature reserve that's commonly known as **"The Vászi"**. In both the countries it overlaps and its surrounding countries this name is frequently used, whereas the name **"Váseim"** is used throughout the countries in Ubunia.

#### Past Life
Nothing about Vászi's past life is known, as he was the original settler of the Temple of Vestia, together with Cziskvelén. Soon after, Vászi would stay behind to guard the newly-founded temple, while Cziskvelén would continue to roam the nature reserve and ultimately lay ground to the *Temple of Álusken*, where he would share Guardian duties with **Settler Matéis**. 

### Settler Cziskvelén
Cziskvelén is a **Swordsman** and **Settler**, having settled the *Temple of Vestia* alongside Vászi, and the *Temple of Álusken* alongside Matéis. Cziskvelén's life has mostly become a legacy, as he is usually mentioned as the "Settler of the modern age", long after the foundation of the *Temple of Zhuehai*, as his own temples would cause more temples to bloom throughout the planet. 

Cziskvelén bears a **Plain White Mask**, albeit more worn down than that of Vászi. Being a swordsman, he also bears a long two-handed sword, which channels light as a power (As seen in Vászi's *Blade of Cziskvelén* Signature). 

### Guardian Marten
Marten, along with a number of others, is a **Junior Guardian** at the Temple of Vestia. Alongside Kágos, he studies to become a Temple Guardian in similar fashion to what Vászi currently is, minus the attire, which he strongly opposes. Unlike Vászi, Marten tends to wear formal clothing, usually meant for winter, that doesn't use the *White/Grey* dress code which is otherwise mandatory for Guardians.

Marten bears **no Mask**, as he is granted one upon completing his apprenticeship. Nevertheless, Marten also stated that he *"strongly dislikes the feel of any mask"*, which may become troublesome to his *Guardian Inheritance*. 

Despite the fact he's mostly against the established standards within the Temple of Vestia, he does have a good heart and the right mindset to become a Guardian, as seen in **EXPOSURE // SNOW**.

#### Past Life
Marten is the only ghost (as of Dec 2023) to not be assigned a new name upon Rebirth. In agreement with Vászi, who guided him through Rebirth, he maintained a set of his memories and pursued his original dream career: Guiding and teaching others. At the time of his death, Marten was 28 years old and actively working towards becoming a university teacher in health and community work, amongst studying regular science. In the end, he fell short to his dreams and was diagnosed with heart cancer, and succumbing to it within a year. Because Vászi believed that Marten had a good enough heart with infinite willpower, he offered him to go through Rebirth and guide him to become a Guardian, giving him a second chance at reaching his dreams.

### Ghost of Luna
Appearance wise, the **Ghost of Luna** can be described as an androgynous person, dressing themselves very nonchalantly and regularly, being very vocal about their strong *distaste* in the traditional clothing of the Guardians and various other ghosts, and continuing to wear the same, basic style of clothing they used to wear before their Last Light.

Luna bears an **Oni Mask**, handcrafted to their preference and integrated a mask featuring *Golden/Red* and Chinese-inspired characters and artworks, as a tribute to the many days they had spent in Matéiazhu ever since being reborn.

#### Past Life
Before their death, Luna was still in college, where they studied computer science and intelligence. Unlike their usual appearance, Luna actually dreamed of getting into fashion and starting their own, non-standard clothing brand. The sudden lapse between their death and rebirth gave them the opportunity to utilize their previously gained knowledge about neuroscience and computer intelligence (As seen in their *Curious Eye* Signature), and while they're still very insecure and shy about it, also allows them to experiment with clothing of their own, now that the entire palette and canvas are available to them.

### Ghost of Snow (Fox)
The **Ghost of Snow** has primarily worn simple, white dresses and suits ever since her Rebirth, still adapting to her sudden changes, especially those that were brought over through the recovery of her spirit by *Vászi* during her Rebirth. Next to wearing primarily white clothing, she also sports long, wavy white hair and possesses the animal characteristics of an *Arctic Fox*, such as her snow-white tail and ears. Smaller details include a slight black tip on her tail, as well as small black spots on her left ear. She has *heterochromia*, as her left eye is a **darker blue** while her right eye is a **faint blue**.

Snow bears a **Kitsune Mask**, which she began personalizing by adding black spots to the left ear, mirroring the black spots on her actual ears, and integrating various pastel colours to *"add colour to the empty space of heaven"*, as she prefers to call it.

#### Past Life
Before her Rebirth, Snow originally was a young man who studied Arts & Crafts, which further explains her continuous struggle to adapt to her new form and new life within the Temple and within the protection of Vászi. Besides this, not much is known about Snow's past life either, except for her previous identity and her cause of death, but what especially sparked Vászi's and Marten's interest is how vastly different her spirit was compared to her physical body. Because of this, Snow and Marten frequently spend time together ever since Snow's Exposure, to go over this and help Snow get more accustomed to her new life. 

## Collapse of United Máneá
### Anita Arkh'ivlam
Zakh'háfo spokesperson. Involved in the Máneán-Zakh'háfon conflict.  
### Makh'lon Uwaalib 
Malawi spokesperson. Currently has no place within the project just yet as Malaw still has to be placed on the planet.  

## Álusken's Mysteries
### Lia Mazsestéia Matthias-Eden Féoresen, II Kunge d-Álusken
Shortened to simply "Matthias-Eden, King Álusken II", he is the second King of Álusken since its inception from the very start of colonial Luniks. Succeeding his Grandmother, **Johanna, Queen Álusken I**, and his father, **Matthias-Déonis, King Álusken I**, he has made radical changes within the country, denying a portion of modern technology, especially in experimental healthcare, something Johanna was very fond of doing, and gave the country its medieval look and state, which it's currently most recognizable by.
