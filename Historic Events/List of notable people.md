# Notable People

## Oslo Revolution (2018 Draft)
### Lars Persson, Sergus Persson (Awaiting inclusion)
Both have led the revolution that took place in Oslo, Norway. However, since the direction and course of the Luniks project has been changed so often and so much, the Oslo revolution no longer fits within the timeline of Luniks. This means both people will either disappear within the story, or stay and become attached to a different story.    
### Ricky Reiut (Awaiting inclusion)
Described above, Reiut is also part of the Oslo revolution, or at least part of the organisation that led up to the revolution. The same applies to Reiut; The Oslo revolution no longer fits in line with Luniks, which means the character will be repurposed or removed.  
### Jonathán Þórirson
Often referred to as the "Settler of the next generation", or simply "Settler of Luniks", Þórirson (Also written as Thórirson), is known this way as he was the first man to set foot on this new planet and settled the first city on the planet as well, *Nóve Réjkjavik*.
### Tagip Panjit 
Panjit is of Indian descent and is the scientific wonder that enabled Earth to leap forward years in time with travelling to Luniks, creating and realising the technology needed to reduce the travel time from 74 years, to just 4.5 hours, with even further shortening options ready to be developed. 
Having studied in Oxford, Tagip came in close contact with the ESA and quickly researched and developed the technology needed to reach Luniks in such speed. 
### Seventh Léjtuse (Awaiting inclusion)
The Seventh Léjtuse is intended to be an insurgent army also involved in the Oslo revolution, but as described with Persson and Reiut above, this is put back to the concept board.

## Leremkov Trials (2022)

Leremkov's story is described in [[Vitaly Leremkov, 2039-2098]].
### Dénis Terczekv (Awaiting inclusion)

### Stacy & David

## GHOST TEMPLES // VESTIA (2023)

### Settler of Vászi
As the **Guardian of Vestia**, the *White/Grey* dress code is mandatory for a Guardian to wear. Because of this, Vászi wears a blacked-out and grey harness, over which he wears a robe or mantle, with a collar that extends far out.

Vászi bears a **Plain White Mask**. He prefers a featureless mask that hides his expressions and body language while guiding a new ghost through Rebirth. This way, he will give the new ghost the most neutral and natural way to process it all, without giving a first impression, be it good or bad, through an altered and personalized mask.

His name, *Settler of Vászi*, is derived from the area in which he settled the Temple of Vestia, which is located between Álusken and Zhuehai, in a nature reserve that's commonly known as **"The Vászi"**. In both the countries it overlaps and its surrounding countries this name is frequently used, whereas the name **"Váseim"** is used throughout the countries in Ubunia.

### Guardian Marten
Marten, along with a number of others, is a **Junior Guardian** at the Temple of Vestia. Alongside Kágos, he studies to become a Temple Guardian in similar fashion to what Vászi currently is, minus the attire, which he strongly opposes. Unlike Vászi, Marten tends to wear formal clothing, usually meant for winter, that doesn't use the *White/Grey* dress code which is otherwise mandatory for Guardians.

Marten bears **no Mask**, as he is granted one upon completing his apprenticeship. Nevertheless, Marten also stated that he *"strongly dislikes the feel of any mask"*, which may become troublesome to his *Guardian Inheritance*. 

Despite the fact he's mostly against the established standards within the Temple of Vestia, he does have a good heart and the right mindset to become a Guardian, as seen in **EXPOSURE // SNOW**.

### Ghost of Luna
Appearance wise, the **Ghost of Luna** can be described as an androgynous person, dressing themselves very nonchalantly and regularly, being very vocal about their *distaste* in the traditional clothing of the Guardians and various other ghosts, and continuing to wear the same, basic style of clothing they used to wear before their Last Light.

Luna bears an **Oni Mask**, handcrafted to their preference and integrated a mask featuring *Golden/Red* and Chinese-inspired characters and artworks, as a tribute to the many days they had spent in Matéiazhu ever since being reborn.

### Ghost of Snow (Fox)
The **Ghost of Snow** has primarily worn simple, white dresses ever since her Rebirth, still adapting to her sudden changes, especially those that were brought over through the recovery of her spirit by *Vászi*. Next to wearing primarily white clothing, she also sports long, wavy white hair and possesses the animal characteristics of an *Arctic Fox*, such as her snow-white tail and ears. 

Snow bears a **Kitsune Mask**, which she began personalizing by adding black spots to the left ear, mirroring the black spots on her actual ears, and integrating various pastel colours to *"add colour to the empty space of heaven"*, as she prefers to call it.

## Collapse of United Máneá
### Anita Arkh'ivlam
Zakh'háfo spokesperson. Involved in the Máneán-Zakh'háfon conflict.  
### Makh'lon Uwaalib
Malawi spokesperson. Currently has no place within the project just yet as Malaw still has to be placed on the planet.  

## Álusken's Mysteries
### Lia Mazsestéia Matthias-Eden Féoresen, II Kunge d-Álusken
Shortened to simply "Matthias-Eden, King Álusken II", he is the second King of Álusken since its inception from the very start of colonial Luniks. Succeeding his Grandmother, **Johanna, Queen Álusken I**, and his father, **Matthias-Déonis, King Álusken I**, he has made radical changes within the country, denying a portion of modern technology, especially in experimental healthcare, something Johanna was very fond of doing, and gave the country its medieval look and state, which it's currently most recognizable by.
