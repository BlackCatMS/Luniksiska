# Notable People

## Oslo Revolution (2018 Draft)
### Lars Persson, Sergus Persson (Awaiting inclusion)
Both have led the revolution that took place in Oslo, Norway. However, since the direction and course of the Luniks project has been changed so often and so much, the Oslo revolution no longer fits within the timeline of Luniks. This means both people will either disappear within the story, or stay and become attached to a different story.    
### Ricky Reiut (Awaiting inclusion)
Described above, Reiut is also part of the Oslo revolution, or at least part of the organisation that led up to the revolution. The same applies to Reiut; The Oslo revolution no longer fits in line with Luniks, which means the character will be repurposed or removed.  
### Jonathán Þórirson
Often referred to as the "Settler of the next generation", or simply "Settler of Luniks", Þórirson (Also written as Thórirson), referred to that way, as he was the first man to set foot on this new planet and settled the first city on the planet as well, *Nóve Réjkjavik*.
### Tagip Panjit 
Panjit is of Indian descent and is the scientific wonder that enabled Earth to leap forward years in time with travelling to Luniks, creating and realising the technology needed to reduce the travel time from 74 years, to just 4.5 hours, with even further shortening options ready to be developed. 
Having studied in Oxford, Tagip came in close contact with the ESA and quickly researched and developed the technology needed to reach Luniks in such speed. 
### Seventh Léjtuse
The Seventh Léjtuse is intended to be an insurgent army also involved in the Oslo revolution, but as described with Persson and Reiut above, this is put back to the concept board.

## Leremkov Trials (2022)

Leremkov's story is described in [[Vitaly Leremkov, 2039-2098]].
### Dénis Terczekv

### Anita Arkh'ivlam
Zakh'háfo spokesperson. Involved in the Máneán-Zakh'háfon conflict.  
### Makh'lon Uwaalib

## Álusken's Mysteries
### Lia Mazsestéia Matthias-Eden Féoresen, II Kunge d-Álusken
Shortened to simply "Matthias-Eden, King Álusken II", he is the second King of Álusken since its inception from the very start of colonial Luniks. Succeeding his Grandmother, Johanna, Queen Álusken I, and his father, Matthias-Déonis, King Álusken I, he has made radical changes within the country, denying a portion of modern technology, especially in experimental healthcare, something Johanna was very fond of doing, and gave the country its medieval look and state, which it's currently most recognizable by.
