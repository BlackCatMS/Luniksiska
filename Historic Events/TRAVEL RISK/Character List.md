## Nils Lorieux
Belongs to **The Agency** (Middleman). \
Equipped with neurotech, including **Wrist Rabbit** (Hacking protocol on wrist)
### Appearance
Nils is a well-built but slim young man, who has since his acquisition into **The Agency** decided to dye his hair blue, to match the Agency's own colour palette of *Blue/Turqouise*. During his training within the Agency, he has opted to exchange his regular casual wear to a more formal type of clothing, wearing a dark blue suit rather than shirts and jeans, to match **Raléi's** outfit too.
### Backstory
Nils's backstory and the course of his life, is available at [[Backstories#Nils]].

## Raléi Alentikíles
Belongs to **The Agency** (Weapons Expert, Owner). \
Equipped with **Stealth Weaponry** (Blade hidden under wrist) and neurotech, including **Wrist Rabbit** (Hacking protocol on wrist) and **Adrenaline surges** (Pulsing streaks on left arm). 
### Appearance
Looks are deceiving, and Raléi knows this. While sharing a similar outfit to **Nils**, a basic navy-blue suit, much more is hidden underneath. Her **Neurotech** was all installed on her left arm, which she accentuated with various tattoos as well, varying from tribal to futuristic and abstract. Having trained in martial arts and having mastered weaponry from melee through marksman rifles, she is a force to be reckoned with.
### Backstory
Raléi's backstory and the course of her life, is available at [[Backstories#Raléi]].

Equipped with various neurotech, including (but not limited to): **Adrenaline boosters** (Fitted on left arm), **Curious Eye** (Digitalised left eye), which can handle zoom and focus up to 4km in distance, and discolours from her natural blue through to yellow-green the further she looks.
### Appearance
While still adjusting to her new silhouette, her visit to Cévok and connection to Dominico greatly helped her imminent deafness with the addition of characteristics of an *Arctic Fox*, accentuating her natural white/blonde hair colour.
