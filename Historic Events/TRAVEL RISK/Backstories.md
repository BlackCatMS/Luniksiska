# Backstories
Each character within **Travel Risk** has a reason why they landed in the situation they find themselves in within the present day. Such as **Nils**, who originally dipped his fingers into grey market trading in order to fund the travel and living costs for his parents returning to **France**, and **Raléi**, who has been meddling with the authorities for as long as she can remember, and instead opted to start a safe haven for those that were brought into the bad cultures that arose in *Fallen Máneá* and *Zakh'háfo* by force. 

## Nils
### Direct Family
Nils has always been a leading figure in taking care of his aging parents. Originally from **Bordeaux, France**, they moved to **Bwiskvá, United Máneá** in hopes to find a better living there. And while they initially had a fantastic time there in their first years, that quickly started to dwindle away as the civil unrest grew day in day out, eventually leading to the *Collapse of United Máneá* in 2039, which immediately led to the collapse of the economy and various cities within the now suddenly-divided country of **Zakh'háfo**. Nils's parents had no influence, opinion, or stances on whether Zakh'háfo should have become independent, but now that it suddenly became an independent nation, the dream of living easily for the rest of their lives became troublesome and grim. 

Despite the collapse, Nils's parents were forced to stay in Bwiskvá and deal with the collapsing economy and wellbeing of the city one way or another. Because of this, Nils didn't have the childhood that his parents had aspired to give him, but as he aged, it became a goal for Nils to restore the dream that his parents had: Live carefree. And with both Máneá and Zakh'háfo having been left to ruin, returning to **France** seemed to be the only viable option.

### Grey Markets and netless netrunning
Reaching his twenties, Nils had no option other than to get to working, fast. His dream was to leave his own wellbeing and life for what it was, and he even went as far as living on the streets, as long as it meant that every cent that he earned would go to his parents' fundings to return to **France**. To achieve this, he moved out into a single-room apartment in Nepestésá to lessen the burden on his parents, and from there on he would begin his *netrunning career*. This was an extremely risky path for him to take, but one he was confident enough in that it would pay off. Without any sort of neurotech in his body, he would have to do small robberies and acts of theft by his mind and skills alone. And to everyone's surprise, it had paid off, and his parents were able to sell their house in Bwiskvá and move back to Bordeaux, France.

### Meeting Antoine, entering Dáritke
In one of his last tasks for his freelance netrunning career, he stumbled upon Antoine Rousseau, who had received an identical task that Nils had been given as well. In turn, the two became good friends and completed their mission, and had quickly grown closer together to become a stellar duo. A few months into their collaborative acts of robbery, Antoine receives an invitation to work for **Dáritke**, and passed the invite along to Nils. Ever since, his **Travel Risk** story begins, and in his first mission he is interrupted by agents from **The Agency**, meeting **Raléi** and stepping out of Dáritke the very same day he was introduced to them.
