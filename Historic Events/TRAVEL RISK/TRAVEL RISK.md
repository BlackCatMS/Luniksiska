# TRAVEL RISK
**TRAVEL RISK**: Certain areas on Earth and Luniks have been deemed *"Unsafe to travel to"*, after numerous incidents related to gang wars and plundering, and general unrest within the area. These areas usually are older, abandoned and out-developed cities that aren't given the same care and supplies that most modern cities receive, with a good example being **Deth-Kelétam (Máneá)**, and **Duisburg (Germany)**. Areas like these include an elevated risk of biological damage upon entrance, and as a result of this, these areas are more prone to diseases like *Leremkov* and *Lucky Water Defect*, leading to results that were even out of the original creator's control. 

# PROJECT REORGANISATION
Per 2024 I want to develop this project in particular into something that can grow into a fully fledged-out story. One that has a clear start, and a clear end, and a series of characters that frequently return and go through the same chapters together. **LUCKY WATER**, **NEUROKICK**, **LEREMKOV**, and every drug that might be created along the way, will be included and will frequently make a return in one way or another. 


## FOCUS ONE: LUCKY WATER
The above described drug, *Lucky Water*, has moved to [[LUCKY WATER]] in order to free up this document as an informative document. 

## FOCUS TWO: NEUROKICK
Available at [[NEUROKICK]]. **NEUROKICK** is an electronic injection-type drug that greatly exaggerates the visual feedback the brain can produce. This additionally can force the user to enter a REM sleep, where the rest of the drug continues its effect during the forced dream state. 

## FOCUS THREE: LEREMKOV
Available at [[LEREMKOV]]. While Leremkov is described as a disease similar to Influenza and Covid, it has been altered and modified even further behind closed, underground doors. Despite not being as prominent as drugs like **Lucky Water**, its effects are more of a threat to the human race than Leremkov itself is.
