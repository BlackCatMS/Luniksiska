# TRAVEL RISK
**TRAVEL RISK**: Certain areas on Earth and Luniks have been deemed *"Unsafe to travel to"*, after numerous incidents related to gang wars and plundering, and general unrest within the area. These areas usually are older, abandoned and out-developed cities that aren't given the same care and supplies that most modern cities receive, with a good example being **Deth-Kelétam (Mánea)**, and **Duisburg (Germany)**. Areas like these include an elevated risk of biological damage upon entrance, and as a result of this, these areas are more prone to diseases like *Leremkov* and *Lucky Water Defect*, leading to results that were even out of the original creator's control.
