### Where Neurotech Fails
*// POV: Nova*

**"You're really confident there's no other way?"** \
*"I'm fully confident there is not. Your hearing could fail with neurotech."*

Dominico rested his hand on my shoulder as I sat on the operation table. No operation would take place, but it was late at night in Cévok, and he had a place and time that would work out. Back when I first got my eye transplant years back, my world was accelerating upwards, an infinitely upwards trend that only brought me to the top. But with all pride comes downfall, and just over a month ago, it was discovered that my hearing was beginning to fail me as a cost. Together with my manager, we looked through the possibilities within neurotech that could rescue my failing ears, and delay my inevitable deafness, but reached a wall right when we started looking. *"This isn't working, Nova."* His voice echoed through my mind. It had been a while since I last spoke to my manager, I took a few weeks off to let this settle in my mind, and the thought of becoming a deaf sniper wasn't leaving my head either. **"What is the point of a sniper, if they can't control their situation?"**

That's when I stumbled upon Dominico in Cévok at a simple nightclub. His appearance was surprisingly official, and after I struck up a conversation with him out of curiosity, the end of the tunnel I was seeing before me lit up again. Dominico explained to me that he was a scientist in DNA technology, and had worked closely with the scientist whose labs in the same city were under siege. Guiding me to a backalley in the club, he offered me help, at the request that I would help him back with assassinating one of his own targets. I was beginning to feel desperate at this stage and was increasingly worried that my hearing would vanish completely, and undo any sort of weapon training that I devoted my entire life to.

And that brings me to the operation table here. *"Triple checking. Arctic fox, you said?"* Dominico asked, tapping a syringe with a strange, bubbly liquid inside. I nodded slowly, the liquid giving me shivers at the thought of having that swirl through my blood. But Dominico took notice of this, and reassured me, smiling gently at my bleak face. *"Worry not, this will make you feel drowsy and tired, but you'll have the best sleep of your life and feel like nothing changed tomorrow."* \
I gulped, crossing my fingers in hopes that what he was telling me the truth, but after a quiet *"I'll apply the dosage now.."* from him, the feeling of nausea and drowsiness immediately overwhelmed me, as if I stood up too quickly after being seated for too long. My entire body began to turn numb, and while Dominico positioning me properly down on the operation table, I could feel my eyes force themselves shut, and my body put itself to sleep.

And ever since, Nova's silhouette had changed for the rest of her life, but it didn't bother her too much. It aided her in her mission, and that was all that mattered. She was seated at the cliff of the *Minttisuáámin Mountains*, that separated Eastern Ellitróómi from Íszkéde, with a rifle in hand. She hadn't bothered with a suppressor this time around, but the mission remained the same: Prove her worth, and climb to the top, literally and figuratively.

It had been a busy time adjusting to her new sense of hearing, and the tail that she gained as a side effect had been causing trouble as well. To Nova, this was much harder to adapt to than when she had her left eye removed and replaced by her one that was packed with neurotech. She could see as far as 4000 metres into the distance in clear detail, managing to pick out her target's eye colour from across the city, but where she aimed to reach the same ceiling in skills with her hearing, she learned she was gradually going deaf in one ear, and neurotech wouldn't be able to rescue it either. 

That's when she had come into contact with Dominico, a scientist from Cévok that had been working in DNA splicing and altering, who offered to help her in her quest to rescue her hearing, while also increasing its capabilities like her upgrade to her left eye. The two made an agreement, Dominico would assist Nova in adapting to her new senses and attributes, and Nova would take out a person that had been bothering Dominico's hard work.  

And that brings her to the present time, seated at the cliff of Minttisuáámin, at 5374m high and vision on the target 10km downwards, in the small village of **Strava Dilávetë**. Her hand was holding the grip of the **Hammerhead H75** firmly, a devastating rifle that she had timeless experience with, and plenty of kills using it. Unable to use a bipod for stability with the way she was seated in the snow at the cliff, she rested the rifle on her knee
