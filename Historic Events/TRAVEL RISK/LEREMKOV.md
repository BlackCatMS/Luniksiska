## Drafted story  
### The Impossible for Everything
Stepping through the door, carefully and quietly closing it behind him, is Nick. An uneasy look and disgruntled expression painted his mood, taking off his shoes in a more annoyed and rapid manner, tossing them on the floor without much further care. **"Un-fuckin'-believable.."** he mumbled to himself, his anger taking a hold of him as he made his way to the living room, playing his briefcase on the coffee table and immediately opening it, revealing a folder of various documents, all stamped with the same company logo: [WIP]  
  
*"What's the matter?"* Leslie asked from the hall across, her quiet footsteps making their way to the living room.  
  
**"Should be self-explanatory, take a read"** Nick mutters back annoyingly, lifting up one of the papers from the folder and holding it up in the air.  
  
Moments pass, and Leslie's expression soon changes from intrigued and interested, to disgust and worry. *"This is a joke, no? Ákros? Leremkov? Are they nuts?"* She says in a panicked voice, and with her body beginning to wobble she carefully sits down on the floor. *"There's no way somebody read and greenlit this. None."*  
  
**"It's a way for us to escape this hellscape of a city."** Nick suddenly interrupts. Leslie looks up, a mixture of confusion and hope in her eyes, while Nick continues. **"It should be straightforward. We take the van, pick up the payload, bring it to Ákros, hand over and receive a return payload, and complete the deal. I've dealt with Leremkov and Neurokicks before in Bwiskvá. I survived, I'm still here, if this makes us what we need to earn, we can leave this city behind and move to Léjtis, to Rhódisz, anywhere but here."**  
  
Leslie's face returns to face the hardwood floor once more, the glimmer of hope she had already disappearing. *"It's way too risky, Nick. There's checkpoints everywhere, we're crossing a border, we'd get killed trying."* She replies, her voice beginning to tremble, that very scenario depicting in her mind.  
  
**"Leslie."** Nick interrupts once more, standing up and making his way to sit beside her across the coffee table. He rests his hand on her shoulder, hoping it'll be enough to return her confidence. **"We'll stick through it together. Hand in hand. We've gone through so much shit together already, we've been dragged through dirt, mud, blood."** Moving her messy hair to the side, he gives her a short kiss on her forehead. **"Think of the life that lies ahead of us. We could live at the Égicmar, we could go to Sórskist, Meskitái, Jíriskod, anywhere we could dream of. Together."**
