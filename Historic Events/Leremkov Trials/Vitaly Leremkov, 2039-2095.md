# Vitaly Leremkov

Vitaly Leremkov *(2039-2095)* was a Russian-Polish biologist who specialized in genetics and DNA. Having studied CRISPR gene editing, he took this several steps further and studied full human DNA altering, creating and shaping mixtures of human and animal genetics, in search for the perfect creature.  
  
Residing himself in Poznań, Poland, where he studied biology and genetical studies, he eventually opened up his first hidden and secret lab in a basement in his small apartment. Making profits off small DNA alteration kits, which would cure and even prevent small forms of COVID, Influenza, and more dangerous diseases, he eventually made himself a millionaire off selling vaccination kits.  
  
Leremkov knew he could easily keep doing this for the rest of his life. As new virus strains came into existence, he could easily find away to combat the strain, create a new vaccine dosage and profit off this, but he wanted more. At 27 years old, he moved out to Kérisant and hid in the plains outside Cévok, creating a steadily-growing laboratory underground which specialised in gene-editing, en masse.  
  
At 32 years old, in **2071**, Leremkov still wasn't satisfied, and things suddenly took a turn for the worse. Going against human morals, he dipped his toes into altering and mixing DNA strains from non-human beings, and started creating new species. A human with a cat's agility, a human with a cow's horns, a human with a pair of dog's ears, a dog's tail and its sense of smell, the list grew and grew, and as long as Leremkov could keep his labs hidden from public sight, it would only be a matter of time before he could gain complete control of the next generations of humanity. Drip-feeding and carefully selling his vaccines as "COVID-Vaccines", his newly-created virus spread, and spread, and spread. It didn't take long before Cévok was in his hands, and from there it would spread by itself. He had created a virus that would spread itself, further and further, Cévok, then Mászdam, then Weshalt, then...  
  
Kérisant went into lockdown in **2075**. The virus had spread into the capital and left and right, people were waking up with these strange animal traits. Going to bed at night with waking up with a fever and a fox's tail were now common occurrences, but nobody had a clue where the cause could be. The vaccines worked fine, COVID and Influenza rates were at an all-time low, and yet, these transformations seemed unexplainable.  
  
Leremkov continued, Kérisant was his, but now that the spread was stopped, he tried to cross the border into Zakh'háfo, into Ellittróómi, but the spread was halted. It was gradually leading to a full standstill, but knowing the power he now held in his hands, Leremkov returned to Poland, trying to incite the virus into his old home city of Poznań, but despite his best efforts, nothing came close to the spread that he caused in Kérisant.  

It's **2092**, 15 years since Kérisant had lifted its lockdown. The spread has gradually slowed down and now primarily passes through birth. The human gene has been irreversibly altered. Leremkov has since stayed in Poznań while his labs in Cévok are under siege. He believed he had taken care of everything, that he had left his labs well-hidden enough that nobody would bat an eye. Despite the increased risk of being caught, he continues to give his best effort to spark his same gene alterations in Poland, determined to break through here too.
  
In **2093**, he strikes luck, and a rare first report sheds the light. Poznań is marked, as Leremkov eagerly waits for his home-brewed genes to spread. Left and right, as the days go by, he spots silhouettes change. Pointy cat ears in the tram, a swinging tail on the sidewalk, majestic antlers in the Starbucks there, as a smile forms on his face. "I've done it" he thinks to himself, again, as he witnesses his own history repeat before his eyes. Having seen Kérisant fall under his control, Poznań, and eventually, all of Poland, was to be next in his hands.  
  
But his pride is short lasted this time, as authorities manage to track down to his labs in his basement in Poznań. His days are numbered, his name is known, and within a matter of hours, Leremkov changes from being hidden, to being known and in the open.  
  
The manhunt on Leremkov begins, potential charges are drawn, but all point to the same goal: execution. Leremkov had done irreversible damage to millions, if not billions, of humans, rendering him impossible to live out of sight of each and every one of the people influenced and changed by his gene strains.  
  
**2095**, Wrocław. Leremkov is on the run. Leremkov is hunted. Since his inception as a biologist, 1.5 million people have been tracked and reported as directly influenced by Leremkov's vaccines, causing their human genes to be altered and changed into those of an animal. And through spread and birth, this number grows to approximately 300 million people indirectly affected by Leremkov.  
  
Humanity, in whatever form it now lives, cannot forgive Leremkov's irreversible damage to humanity.  
  
November 18th, **2095**. Sirens echo through the city of Wrocław as Leremkov has been tracked and found. With a racing heart, he runs, further and further away from his temporary home in Wrocław. Everything is left behind, his paperwork, his documents, everything that traces back to him is left behind in his room, as he runs, away from the city while the sirens follow him, gunshots echoing between the walls.  
  
Hidden in an alleyway, Vilaly takes a breath. At 56, he has lost practically all his stamina he once had at 19, when he went through the university's doors for the first time. What a life it's been, what a legacy he will leave behind, forever marked in history, forever marked as the creator, the fabricator of new races, what was once thought impossible.  
  
Vitaly steps out of the alleyway, the flashing lights of the police sirens are still noticeable in the walls of the city, no matter where he looks, no matter where he goes, he will be captured, he will be tried, and he will forever be tortured.  
  
Carefully sneaking towards the bridge, he sees it's completely empty as he moves up towards the middle, sirens following behind him, as one last thought enters his mind.  
  
Opening and raising his arms, he stares into the night sky, the searchlight of a helicopter blinding his eyes as a gun is revealed from his thick coat. Clenching his first and aiming it at the sky, his pistol held tightly in his other hand, he screams at the stars, "The worlds owe me!"  
  
Turning to his left, his pistol presses against his head, as he stares to the river one last time. The police sirens are deafening, the sounds of the helicopter above him echo through his ears. The shouting police officers don't even register to his brain anymore, as he closes his eyes, his pistol firmly in his hands, as one last shiver goes through his spine as the trigger pulls.  
  
And the lights go off.
