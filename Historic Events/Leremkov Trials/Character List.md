## David Huybrechts & Stacy Eweyck
From the drafted "victim story" in [[PENDULUM]]. \
### David Huybrechts
*Belgian* descent. Earth 2073. \
**Occupation**: Student scientist and biologist at the Antwerpen hospital. \
**Brief description**: From a young age onwards, David was fascinated by biology and nature and wanted to study medicine and healthcare for as long as he could remember. Enrolling into the Antwerpen university was a dream come true for him, where he proceeded to study experimental medicine and its effects on both mice and humans. \
**Current occupation**: Within the hospital of Antwerpen, he is currently researching the long-term genetic effects of Leremkov on people that have never been infected directly, with **Stacy Eweyck** being one of those people. For his final paper for his university, he and Stacy would find out what the long-term effects of Leremkov really mean, and if this is a cause of danger or a sudden normality.

### Stacy Eweyck
*Belgian* descent. Earth 2075. \
**Occupation**: Student at AP Antwerpen. \
**Brief Description**: Having been born from a mother that was infected by Leremkov, and a father that chose to undergo therapy from **PENDULUM**, Stacy was born a human with the various features of a fox, which she inherited from her parents. Because of this, she knows no different, because she never had a chance to experience being a "normal" human, but despite this she made an excellent effort in her younger years to normalise herself throughout her life.
**Current Occupation**: After coming in touch with **David**, the two are undergoing various research protocols and are taking tests to come to a conclusion what mental and physical effects an inherited or genetic Leremkov infection might cause or prevent, and how vastly different yet normal Stacy is going through her life with these features.

## Vienna Méckláz & Olen Rosenqvist
Vienna and Olen are both part of the Leremkov treatment centre that aid those that have to suddenly adapt to changes that were caused by Leremkov.

### Olen Rosenqvist
*Swedish* descent. Earth 2035.  \
**Occupation**: Supervisor at Post-Leremkov treatment.  \
**Brief description**: Olen was born and raised in Uppsala, Sweden, but moved together with his family to Kérisant when he was 12. Ever since, he had gained a growing passion for animals, frequently spending time at various community farms and on the plains of Cévok to help take care of the animals, as well as simply spending his time to peacefully rest together with them. At 19 years, he enrolled in the University of Kérisant, devoting the next few years of his life into animal health and treatment, eager to be a first responder to helping animals in need. \
**Current role**: Rosenqvist was one of the first people to be affected by Leremkov, calling in sick for work one day in 2071, and waking up late in the evening with his ears in the wrong place, picking up all sorts of weird smells, and especially finding a dog's tail behind him. After a few weeks of adjusting, life surprisingly resumed to normal as he continues his job at the animal hospital and research area, before meeting **Vienna** one day in a similar situation. Together, they founded the first *Leremkov Victim Centre* division in the *National Kérisantic hospital*, giving aid and support to those affected by Leremkov and need guidance to adjust to their new bodies and roles. 
  
### Vienna Méckláz
*Kérisantic* descent. Luniks 2046.  \
**Occupation**: Scientist, nurse, guardian, at Post-Leremkov treatment.\
**Brief description**: Vienna was born as Julian in Weshalt, Kéristant, but has come out as transgender already in her early years of high school, where she then quickly found the role of a nurse appealing as a future job. Always having been a caring and careful person with a kind heart, she enrolled in Cévok College in 2065, and started to take serious steps in reaching her dream job. \
**Current role**: During an internship in her Master in 2071, she became affected by Leremkov after repeatedly coming in contact with others already affected, waking up completely disoriented as she gained various traits from an antelope. Despite this, she completed her Master and graduated, and instead agreed to devote her body to research into reducing the effects of Leremkov and experimenting if it was reversible in any way. These experiments instead ended up accelerating and worsening any changes still in stock for her, as she also gained the legs and hooves of an antelope, as well as her left shoulder and arm gaining a similar patterned fur. After this incident, she quickly learned how to adjust to her new role, as any further experiments were ruled out. With her new body, she stumbled upon **Olen** in 2071, and agreed to become a guardian and supportive person with the intent to aid those that underwent a similar, sudden change.
