### 23-07-96 - Panjit Loop test succeeds
*Voice message from Petrus Masego to Prof. Lesenen* 

Alexis, I can't believe I get to say this, but your Indian wonder kid actually did it. We've sent a space probe through the wormhole, the loop, through the Panjit, the terms you're using at the EESA are beyond me, but we received a signal a few lightyears away, with success. The probe arrived intact, and we'll get started on minor testing now. I've attached a few of the unprocessed photos that the LNK-1 probe sent, but the view is unbelievable. Can you believe it? She looks just like Earth, it's always said that Earth was a shot in the dark, a one in a trillion chance to support life at all, intelligent life at that. But looking at these photos, looking at her beauty, I think we threated the needle through an atom and struck cosmic gold yet again. 

I'll forward the fantastic news to Tagip, you pass it onto the university. I think we have a real shot at finding our next home here. And yes, I can read your thoughts, Alexis, worry not. We'll iterate the probes and gather more data as we go, but our biggest challenge is probably testing if a colonial spaceship can survive a test through the loop. I'll keep you informed, but until then, don't consider champagne off the cards. This deserves to be celebrated.

Masego out!

### 01-01-01 - Activity around unsettled Zhuehai region
*Voice message from Petrus Masego to Prof. Lesenen*

Happy new year, Alexis! Hope it's been a good one, the nineties are really behind our backs now! Anyway, I messaged you again to inform you about what the LTL-4 telescope had spotted at nighttime on Lúniks, it's pretty fascinating. Now of course, we haven't found any life in detail just yet, but probe ELL-2 did test in a group of forests on unsettled Thórirsant and picked up sounds that could be considered to be similar to the group calls of deer, but that's for another time. What I'd like to show you is the strange auroras that LTL-4 has been keeping its eyes on for the past few days. It seems to only appear during nighttime, but there's a clear aurora appearing above the unsettled Taiwanese region on Vestia, and nowhere else. To make matters more strange, the aurora doesn't appear above either of the magnetic poles. It seems something, magical, is taking place here, but we'll do more testing and I'll let you know once we get a clearer picture. Until then, might pass on the banana bread recipe? Been thinking of making that at home.. I'm trailing off, sorry!

I'll return to my usual work in Johannesburg, until then, keep up the great work and let me know whenever Akájune needs my attention regarding the Starship prototype.

Masego out!
