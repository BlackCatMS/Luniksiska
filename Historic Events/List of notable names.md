# Interplanetary Travel

## ELE - Earth-Luniks Express
Soon after Luniks was first settled, it became a top priority to establish a stable and steady connection between the two planets. Initially, the travel ports were build and activated between Switzerland and Nóve Rejkjavík, with many other ports quickly being built afterwards to allow a smooth transfer of many people that had an intent to move to Luniks and help settle the young planet. Because of its rapid activation, Luniks could grow as quickly as it has.

**ELE** travels through the wormhole that's also referred to as the *Panjit Loop*, which is named after **Tagip Panjit**, who was the key factor to discovering the methods towards fast interplanetary travel and enabled travel to Luniks in the first place.


# Rail Services
Each nation has their own national railway, which will slowly spring to life as this document evolves, but until then, the existing rail companies and lines are described in this section. 

Despite being set in the near future where space travel is a reality, travel by train has stayed relatively the same, albeit more dense and more important.  
  
Separate passenger and cargo corridors were created in order to make passenger and cargo transport completely independent of one another. Having survived a bankruptcy on Earth, Railpool has found its place in cargo transport throughout and between Thórirsant and Kérisant, maintaining a tight connection and almost exclusive use of Siemens locomotives.
## LTS - Lúnikska Trén Service
LTS as a company frequently reappears throughout the story, although it only services connections between the various countries on **Ubunia**. 

## RKU - Rail Klaszi Ubunia
RKU provides international services between **Thórirsant**, **Kérisant**, and **Zakh'Háfo**, providing both cargo and passenger transport.

## Vestia Rapid
Vestia Rapid is the high-speed train service that operates between the various nations across Vestia. Its connections range from **Hédenis** and **Mónsan**, through **Zhuehai**, **Álusken**, and **Vao**, with split connections to **Benelux** and **Denmark**. Its most known for the fatal rail incident ever since its inauguration, as described in [[LAST LIGHT#// LUNA]]. 

Currently planned (December 2023) is developing a brand identity for this service. Taken from the Trello board: \
*Existing concept is a slogan of “Wherever you're going, we'll bring you there”, or "Across the road or across the border, we'll bring you there." Some examples include:* \
"Whether you're going to:
- Sui Donnore
- Ippavím 
- Myriapolou
- Shánzhe
- Lëtzebuerg
- Matéiazhu

We'll bring you there."

*Alternatively, this list of examples can also be exchanged for simply a list of cities that are connected to Vestia Rapid. Next to that, Vestia Rapid can also be transformed into a general rail company, also providing a means of regional and intercity transport without incredible speeds as their VR20s. However, this might need a rebrand, and exchange the "Rapid" name for something else, such as "Vestia Regio".*

*Planned is a combination of purple and grey colours with stock high speed rail footage. Just like now LTS banners were proposed and created as a concept, the same process should happen for the brand identity of Vestia Rapid.*

## Máneán Metro
Despite the **Collapse of United Máneá**, the metro keeps its original name and services various cities within both **Máneá** and **Zakh'háfo**, where it services various big cities such as their respective capitals. 


# Ship Services
Only a couple of cargo services by ship exist throughout all of Luniks. This is because overseas shipment has mostly been replaced by solar plane cargo.

## Álusken-Thórirsant Ferry
A ferry (rather, a cruise ship) connects the two continents of Ubunia and Vestia, providing a ferry both ways every 3 hours. 


# Common Brands
## Norden Supermarkets
Prominent in the north of Álusken (Hence the name **Norden**) is **Norden Supermarktir**, which have been established soon after the handover from *Queen Álusken I's* reign to that of *King Álusken II*, who then attempted to get rid of every sort of modern service since the start of his reign. In a desperate attempt to survive, Norden opened its first few markets in the south of **Vao**, and once it became clear that the plans that King Álusken II had made would be limited to within the boundaries of the capital, Norden quickly returned to the north of Álusken, where it has since outgrown its competitors.

## Hammerhead 
**Hammerhead** is a Vestian industry appliances manufacturer, who is best known for snowballing the expansion and normalisation of the settlement of Vestia, soon after the borders were drawn upon landing on Luniks. 

## Carbine
Next to offering a various catalogue of weapons, **Carbine** is in the hunt to reach the same level of market share that **Hammerhead** currently has. Jealous of their achievements, Carbine entered the experimental weapon department, in hopes to create a new image for themselves where they failed trying to chase after Hammerhead.
