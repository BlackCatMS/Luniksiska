# List of notable names
This document lists various names, such as those of products, companies, or other various names that might reappear frequently through the different stories and items, as a dictionary and collection.

# Rail Services
Each nation has their own national railway, which will slowly spring to life as this document evolves, but until then, the existing rail companies and lines are described in this section. 

Despite being set in the near future where space travel is a reality, travel by train has stayed relatively the same, albeit more dense and more important.  
  
Separate passenger and cargo corridors were created in order to make passenger and cargo transport completely independent of one another. Having survived a bankruptcy on Earth, Railpool has found its place in cargo transport throughout and between Thórirsant and Kérisant, maintaining a tight connection and almost exclusive use of Siemens locomotives.
## LTS - Lúnikska Trén Service
LTS as a company frequently reappears throughout the story, although it only services connections between the various countries on **Ubunia**. 

## RKU - Rail Klaszi Ubunia
RKU provides international services between **Thórirsant**, **Kérisant**, and **Zakh'Háfo**, providing both cargo and passenger transport.

## Vestia Rapid
Vestia Rapid is the high-speed train service that operated between **Zhuehai**, **Álusken**, with split connections to **Denmark** and **Benelux**, which is most known for the fatal rail incident ever since its inauguration, as described in [[GHOST TEMPLES - LAST LIGHT#// LUNA]]. 

Currently planned (December 2023) is developing a brand identity for this service. Taken from the Trello board: \
*Existing concept is a slogan of “We’ll bring you there”*

*Planned is a combination of purple and grey colours with stock high speed rail footage. Just like now LTS banners were proposed and created as a concept, the same process should happen for the brand identity of Vestia Rapid.*


# Ship Services
Only a couple of cargo services by ship exist throughout all of Luniks. This is because overseas shipment has mostly been replaced by solar plane cargo.

## Álusken-Thórirsant Ferry
A ferry (rather, a cruise ship) connects the two continents of Ubunia and Vestia, providing a ferry both ways every 3 hours.
