# GHOST TEMPLES
Location: Undecided, presumably spread all over the planet.  
  
Located throughout the planet in seemingly desolate places, such as ancient forests, empty grass plains, or hidden right in the heart of a blooming city, are various mysterious temples. Dating back to almost the very start of the first settlements of Lúniks, they are visually similar to other temples that are seen in Old Asia, as well as the first wave in Zhuehai.  
  
These temples contain a deep, hidden secret. They are usually surrounded by a curious, lingering white mist, hiding the temple from any trespasser, until they're practically at the gate. Beyond the gate, is a cold, grand, and open temple space, decorated with gold statues, ancient banners, but if it's so cold and seemingly left alone, why are these temples such a secret?  
  
These temples are frequently visited and occupied by masked ghosts, each wearing a mask they've crafted themselves, meaning every ghost or shadow is a unique one. Their names might have been lost after they vanished in their previous lives, but their new identity is what makes them stand out in their own way.  
  
Some of these ghosts adore terrorising regular everyday people, others adore the freedom and vastness of the countryside, and spend the rest of their days here. But one curious ghost prefers to find their own, previous identity. With a handcrafted oni mask, they roam the streets throughout all of Vestia, until their eyes land on a peculiar person.  
  
Each temple has a name and a set of present symbols (Elements, Zodiacs, Sprits) that represent the state and wellbeing of the temple and its ghosts. Additionally, a temple also has a Guardian, a ghost that has pledged their existence to guard their temple, in the event something endangers the safety of the temple.

### Drafted Story
Roaming through the vivid and bright streets of Matéiazhu, hidden behind a mask and seen by nobody, is a young ghost. They lost their lives in a shock derailment incident on their way home from Zhuehai to Benelux, in the first deadly rail incident since the opening of the planetary rail network, at least 30 years prior. Ever since, they've been stuck in Zhuehai, forever longing to go home, but instead needing to find comfort behind a mask, roaming through the streets, eyeing every passerby, some familiars, mostly strangers. With their head down, they reach behind a corner store, taking a seat on top of the garbage collector, their hand resting on their cheek as they stare into the busy street. Every single night has passed like this. Staring at the busy street, eager and desperate to join the masses, but just being invisible to everyone, hidden behind a mask.  
*"Is everything alright? You look exhausted.."* a young voice suddenly sounds behind them. Shockingly, they turn around, now facing a girl of about 19 years old, gazing deeply into their eyes. Completely taken aback by the situation, they stare back, their voice long gone as the girl gradually grows impatient. *"I don't have all day, I can help if you want me to"*.  
Struggling to find the right words, knowing they last spoke a word all those years ago on the train, they lift their hand, pointing at the girl. **"You can.. see me?**" They ask, a raspy, distinct, yet slightly digitalized voice coming from behind the mask. In response, the girl nods, her already low amount of fear and doubt dropping to the floor as she draws closer, analysing the ghost's mask. *"You have a mesmerizing mask, it's so delicate.. Is it handmade?"* She tenderly asks, making clear she means no harm in the slightest.  
**"It's.. old.. but made by myself."** The ghost mutters back, slowly regaining their long lost comfort in speaking, as they loosen up as well, gradually gaining trust in this mysterious girl before him. "I must know", they start, as they slowly drop down from the garbage collector, **"How are you able to see me? You are the first in years, this should be impossible."**  
Instead of directly answering the question, the curious girl continues to overanalyse the ghost's mask, eager to point out smaller details, finding a crescent moon mark, the emblem of Vestia, and the symbol of Jérrat, beautifully integrated into the mask's white and gold colourway. Suddenly, she breaks the now minute-long silence, carefully looking into their eyes. *"It's strange. I've seen you around more often, as well as other masked people. I thought everyone systematically ignored you, but if I'm alone in being able to see you..-"*  
The ghost suddenly interrupts, with their hand on their chest, gripping tightly on their suit. **"I've seen other ghosts. An Ox's mask, a Fox's mask, oddest of all, a broken mask of a Deer. If you've seen them too, it must be a sign. It must mean something."**  
Nodding slowly, the girl's confidence seems to stagger as her eyes now face the floor, eyeing the ghost's shoes, but not in detail. Speaking softly, she gradually looks back up to face the ghost's mask. *"I've been meaning to ask, but if I may, what is your name?"*  
A shiver runs through the ghost's phantom body, as flashbacks suddenly race through their mind. A vision of the train, a vision of family, all sorts of familiar faces, familiar places, seemingly so far away, as words and names refuse to formulate and connect. Raising their hand to their face, they once more struggle to collect words, before finally looking back into the girls eyes, responding confidently and clearly.  
**"I am the Ghost of Luna. For now, that is all that matters."**

### What's next?
For **// EXPOSURE**, the main approach is following the Ghost of Luna through their story and describe their experience as a ghost, starting from the very moment of the rail incident in Zhuehai, all the way towards the complete connection of temples spread throughout the planet, maybe even hinting at temples located back at Earth?

### Drafted Story
*POV: Ghost of Kitsune*

I woke up feeling sore and cold all over, my body felt out of place, but I couldn't lay a finger on what exactly was wrong, the first things I noticed were that the market had been abandoned, filled to the brim with lingering clouds of dust, as if a bomb had gone off; the roof had collapsed near the central aisles, which would explain the cold breeze I was feeling.  
I slowly tried to move myself upwards, getting more and more accustomed with my shifted body, knowing I'm the same person as I was before, yet also, having no idea where, or rather when, I am. My memories slowly started to seep back in my mind, but as hard as I tried to form a picture of what happened, of who I was, more and more holes began to appear in the picture in my mind, as if it was actively being erased, as if I was forgetting my past right in this very moment. 
Gripping myself on the shelves, I slowly and carefully work my way upright, my legs wobbling as I breathe roughly, coughing often from the dust cloud lingering through the entire market. Slowly looking around, I see right away where I am, the exact same aisle, the exact same place, as where I last saw myself before fainting. But yet again, my vision blurs, colours fade, and as quickly as I begin to remember where I am, I begin to forget.

Groaning softly, I fall back to the floor and move my hand to my forehead, feeling it throb as blood surges through my body as I gradually come to be. A vision repeatedly pulses through my mind, an image of a formally dressed, masked man, black shirt, white robe, a mask completely covering his face, white..
**"It appears you have awoken, young ghost."** 
A voice booms through the market, echoing off every wall as I turn my head upwards, facing the strange figure that I just pictured in my mind right before me. Millions of questions come to me right away, but none exist my mouth as I only manage to let out a soft gasp, feeling like I'm unable to speak, as if I'm silenced by the strange aura emitted by the figure before me.
**"Speaking is not advised. It appears you have died."** He says without emotion. Through his mask, I can feel his eyes stare deeply into mine, my body shivering as I now feel completely helpless, completely lost. Feeling tears already begin to build up as every emotion rushes through my mind, from fear to confusion, to anger and sadness, he opens his robe, and reveals a mask. 
**"This will help you speak. Please understand and put it on."**
Carefully taking the mask from his hand, I study it deeply. A plain, white mask with fox characteristics, especially with its enormous tipped ears. Gulping as I wipe the tears I tried to hide away, I put on the mask, feeling a new stream of energy and warmth instantly stream through my body as I reopen my eyes, gazing upwards at the mysterious figure before me, trying to scramble together the right words.
*"What's.. going on?"*
**"I am the Settler of Vászi. You are the Ghost of Kitsune. Together, we are part of the Temple of Vestia. I understand this is a lot of information to take in at once, for that, I'm sorry"**
Finishing his words, Vászi carefully bows in an apologetic manner, his robe delicately wrapping around him in a protective manner, almost as if it's a defensive manouvre. In response, I crawl upwards, my legs continuing to wobble, now fully aware of the situation I, and my body, are in, while more and more information seeps into my mind from the mask. Catching my breath and readying my words, I prepare myself for the worst of answers.
*"Vászi, if I may ask, what.. happened?"*
Without hesitation, the Settler takes a step forward to put a hand on my shoulder, his other hand revealing a copy of an ID card, and flips it around, revealing a small mirror, which in turn reveals my face, mismatching the pictured face on the ID card, as I feel a cold shiver run through my body upon realisation.
**"On October 4th, 2075, a missile struck the market you find yourself in. At the same time, criminals entered through the North and South sides to plunder and raid the market. Ever since, it has been left vacant. We were not able to rescue your body, but we rescued your soul, and gave you another chance in the body that matches your soul."**
