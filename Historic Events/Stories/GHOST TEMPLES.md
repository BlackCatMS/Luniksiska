# GHOST TEMPLES
Location: Spread over the entire planet (With a planned expansion on Earth)
  
Located throughout the planet in seemingly desolate places, such as ancient forests, empty grass plains, or hidden right in the heart of a blooming city, are various mysterious temples. Dating back to almost the very start of the first settlements of Lúniks, they are visually similar to other temples that are seen in Old Asia, as well as the first wave in Zhuehai.
  
These temples contain a deep, hidden secret. They are usually surrounded by a curious, lingering white mist, hiding the temple from any trespasser, until they're practically at the gate. Beyond the gate, is a cold, grand, and open temple space, decorated with gold statues, ancient banners, but if it's so cold and seemingly left alone, why are these temples such a secret?  
  
These temples are frequently visited and occupied by masked ghosts, each wearing a mask they've crafted themselves, meaning every ghost or shadow is a unique one. Their names might have been lost after they vanished from their previous lives, but their new identity is what makes them stand out in their own way.  
  
Some of these ghosts adore teasing regular everyday people, some adore the freedom and vastness of the countryside, and spend the rest of their days here, and others might seek a trace to their previous, now lost identity. 
  
Each temple has a name and a set of present symbols (Elements, Zodiacs, Sprits) that represent the state and wellbeing of the temple and its ghosts. Additionally, a temple also has a set of Guardians, ghosts that have pledged their existence to guard their temple, in the event something endangers the safety of the temple.  

## The Lifecycle
Every ghost has gone through three stages upon introduction to their new Temple. These are:
- **LAST LIGHT** // The event that led to their death in their original life.
- **REBIRTH** // The process in which a Guardian rescues and restores the spirit of someone that has gone through *Last Light*.
- **EXPOSURE** // The event in which everything clicks together. Every memory that was able to be restored from the rescued spirit has been restored, and the new Ghost has now been permanently connected to their corresponding Temple. 

*// The cycle below is events that happen during the end of a lifetime for a ghost. However, said cycle is still on the drawing board and might end up being excluded altogether*

- ***DESPAIR** // The stage in which the quality of life of the Ghost or Temple is rapidly declining and in danger of running out.* // The **DESPAIR** entry is currently used in *DESPAIR // VÁSZI*, carrying a different meaning.
- ***TRAGEDY** // The event in which the Temple falls, or in which the ghost simply dies and vanishes, leaving behind just their mask.*

## A quick rundown
The current focus lays on the **Temple of Vestia**, where a small group of characters is actively being developed and have sprung to life. This list of characters is still rapidly growing, but is available at [[List of notable people#GHOST TEMPLES // VESTIA (2023)]], as well as under its corresponding header in the current page. 

Each Temple has a **Settler**, which reflects in the symbol that is created upon the foundation of the temple, and will forever be stored as a *plaque* within the *Memorial Hall*. Within this Hall, all sprits of present and past ghosts are available, as well as basic information regarding the temple and its symbols. The symbols are properly explained at [[GHOST TEMPLES - Scattered Info#Known Symbols]].

A **Settler** possesses a tremendously high amount of *Spiritual Energy*, the same energy that forms around a Guardian's Signature *Guarding Light*. In order to become a **Settler** and settle your own Temple, *Guardianship* is a requirement, which is why many Ghosts choose to go through Guardian Apprenticeship, in order to gain the required knowledge, but also the required skills and power, to settle a Temple close to their birthplace, or place of death. 

**Cziskvelén** and **Vászi** are the Settlers of the *Temple of Vestia*. It's widely believed that **Cziskvelén** was granted his Guardianship by a higher, unknown power, which he himself referred to as *"The Higher Spirit"*, and passed this knowledge onto Vászi before settling the *Temple of Vestia*. However, as the *Temple of Zhuehai* is much older, there is also a legend that **Cziskvelén** is the *Higher Spirit* himself, and has since guided Settlers like **Guǎnzhù**, **Matéis**, and **Yun Li** to settle their own Temples first, before disappearing after the *Temple of Álusken* was settled.
