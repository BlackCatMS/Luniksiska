# GHOST TEMPLES
Location: Undecided, presumably spread all over the planet.  
  
Located throughout the planet in seemingly desolate places, such as ancient forests, empty grass plains, or hidden right in the heart of a blooming city, are various mysterious temples. Dating back to almost the very start of the first settlements of LÃºniks, they are visually similar to other temples that are seen in Old Asia, as well as the first wave in Zhuehai.  
  
These temples contain a deep, hidden secret. They are usually surrounded by a curious, lingering white mist, hiding the temple from any trespasser, until they're practically at the gate. Beyond the gate, is a cold, grand, and open temple space, decorated with gold statues, ancient banners, but if it's so cold and seemingly left alone, why are these temples such a secret?  
  
These temples are frequently visited and occupied by masked ghosts, each wearing a mask they've crafted themselves, meaning every ghost or shadow is a unique one. Their names might have been lost after they vanished in their previous lives, but their new identity is what makes them stand out in their own way.  
  
Some of these ghosts adore terrorising regular everyday people, others adore the freedom and vastness of the countryside, and spend the rest of their days here. But one curious ghost prefers to find their own, previous identity. With a handcrafted oni mask, they roam the streets throughout all of Vestia, until their eyes land on a peculiar person.  
  
Each temple has a name and a set of present symbols (Elements, Zodiacs, Sprits) that represent the state and wellbeing of the temple and its ghosts. Additionally, a temple also has a Guardian, a ghost that has pledged their existence to guard their temple, in the event something endangers the safety of the temple.
