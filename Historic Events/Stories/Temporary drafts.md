## GHOST TEMPLES
### Character: Ghost of Winter
The **Ghost of Winter** is a fairly young girl, with the animal traits of a *Snow Leopard*, and is frequently seen wearing thicker types of clothing, traditionally suited for winter weather, contra *Snow*, who is also a "Ghost of Winter" in a sense, but instead wears more thin dresses.

Having mentioned Snow, she and Winter get along very well, and are sometimes almost passed along as twins, despite Winter originally coming from Karlsborg whereas Snow lived in Keustellet before both of their respective *Last Lights*. 

Winter was led through *Rebirth* by **Temple Guardian Marten**, which is why she was immediately introduced to **Snow**, and why the three get along together well now. Originally having refuged in their home, they now simply live together as a family.

Winter has two **Signatures**:
- **Arctic Blaze**: Similarly to Snow's *Whiteout*, Winter summons a shallow dome of a snowstorm that traps and encompasses only the targets she intends to cast her Signature on. She frequently mentions that she "Feels home in the snow", which is why she also uses her Arctic Blaze similarly to Snow's Whiteout, when she feels like she needs to regain a moment of peace.
- **Channelling Leopald**: Similarly to Snow's *Channeling Astárout*, Winter channels the ancient power of the **Spirit of Leopald**, a myth in Álusken's culture, to give her an extra surge of energy and strength. 

Winter's three stages can be summarised as follows:
- **Last Light**: Winter travelled together with a group of friends through the woods of Morrésik, having planned this journey for many years and finally deciding on taking it this winter. During this trip, they set up camp in various spots and cityhop along the way, and after passing the village of **Myradsked**, they cross the border of Mónsan into the wilds. Winter eventually lost her life as she fell into a ravine that was covered up by snow, and was given another chance at life by **Marten** due to her *"pure, healthy, and warm soul"*.
- **Rebirth**: With the help of **Sóvis**, **Marten** guides Winter through her rebirth in the woods of Morrésik, just shy of the border of Mónsan and near the city of **Ti Péli**. With the three of them, Winter adapts to her body on the way back towards the Temple of Vestia, having a very hopeful and understanding sense of mind as compared to the usual behaviour of ghosts so soon after rebirths. 
- **Exposure**: Almost immediately after her Rebirth, Winter immediately understood the new world she found herself in, and adapted to it as if it was her second nature. Her Exposure will be where she meets **Snow**, soon after her rebirth, since **Marten** brings her along for shelter and care. Upon meeting Snow, the two immediately get along and immediately seem like twins, which is how Winter integrates into the Temple of Vestia right away.


## TRAVEL RISK
- Drafted: Touch on Leremkov and hitting its limits within the depths of Deth-Kelétam.
- Drafted: Prologue story to **LUCKY WATER** and Nils's first interaction with the company that Antoine referred him to. Additionally, a side-story that encompasses Nils and Antoine meeting again after a period of time, maybe together with Raléi, where Nils confronts Antoine and asks him why he ever referred him to partake in drug dealing. 


## Leremkov - PENDULUM

## Cities per Nation
### Máneá (Unifísai Ertbitsai da Máneá)
#### Deth-Kelétam
Frequently dubbed as the "Capital of drugs", Deth-Kelétam served home soon after the collapse of Máneá, and its deteriorated automated transport system still chugs along to this day, giving way to every sort of illegal trade in broad daylight. 

### Mónsan Republic
#### Ti Péli

#### Myradsked

### Free State of Léjtis
Léjtis is placed on the island under **Máneá** and **Zakh'háfo**. This is reflected on the 2020 map sketch.
#### Pórtvéj (Capital)

#### Jíriskod
