## Leremkov - PENDULUM
Self insert into pendulum - Receive aid and care through Vienna & Olen.

## Reaching Lúniks- Once We Reach Lúniks
This story is as good as done, but needs to receive a proper proofread and touchups accordingly, which will improve the flow drastically. Currently, it's lacking a lot.

## Reaching Lúniks - Emails
Email (2005) from Masego to Lesenen regarding lander ELL-6 (Vaon Lander) losing connection after getting destroyed. This lander was intended to analyse the Vaon auroras in thorough detail from the ground upwards. Supposedly, a strange force destroyed ELL-6, and will need proper analysis when Vestia begins allocation and settlement.

Email (2006) from Akájune to Masego and Lesenen regarding his concerns about developing **Five**, and its necessity. The ESA proposed to iterate and develop **Five**, based off the functions for **Three** and **Four**, the last of which is due to depart a week from writing. \
Akájune describes that it would be the smartest to have **Two** return to Earth and restock, especially with reports that it's still in perfect shape and would have enough fuel to survive a Loop jump and travel to France. \
A return email from Lesenen should include the ESA's response and plan for having **Two** return to Earth as a handshake trade while **Four** lands with new supplies and people.

Email (2009) regarding the completed allocation of Ubunia and commencement of allocation of Vestia. Ships **Two** through **Four** carry the necessities, while lander ELL-9 begins its research in Deónia.

## TRAVEL RISK - Mika's Backstory
What bought Mika to Dáritke? How come he has so much neurotech installed in his body? Mika's backstory should make this clear.

## TRAVEL RISK - Nova Character 
**Nova** (Katherina): A cold-blooded sniper and marksman expert that has up to 30 untraced kills to her name. Most notable for landing a clean shot from 400 metres away, without using a scope. The signs point to her having neurotech in her left eye, which may be the reason she's as precise as she is. Mono Nova for her quiet and untraced shots. She expertises in every sort of calibre, in every climate, and against every target. Once she has you in her sights, godspeed.

Nova will be recruited into an Agency after having undergone military training and service in Eastern Kérisant, partaking in the Mharáni unrest, and is originally from **Strava Mikkëi**.
