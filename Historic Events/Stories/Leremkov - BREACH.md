# Leremkov - BREACH
*BREACH* is an in-depth look at how **Dénis Tercekv** infiltrated Leremkov's secret *Genetic Labs*, where he produced the vaccine that cause the irreversible damage to humanity's genes and DNA. As a start, various snippets will be developed, after which they will gradually be tied together and form a cohesive story. 

## Drafted Story
### INFILTRATE 
A loud static could be heard in the back of the car, notifying Dénis that he had left his transmitter in the back seat. *"--ou read? Over"* could be heard, and was repeated another two times before Dénis had enough and picked up the transmitter, sending a signal back. **"Lion Squad. We read. Over."** \

It was a scorching hot day. One could argue it was a day far too hot to execute a plan like this in such a heat, especially with how badly the newly designed Pulse Rifles behave in the blazing sun. With a deep sigh, Dénis took his bottle of water and took a deep sip, with Leo smirking from the driver's seat, noticing the suspiciously bring flower fields approaching. **"Seems we're getting close. Make sure your rifle is armed and warmed, you don't want that failing on you in combat."** Dénis scoffed, shaking his head as he looked in the mirror of the car, seeing two more trucks driving behind them. *"There's Eagle and Tiger squads.."* he thought to himself, the small warehouse-like building approaching quickly, with the flower fields right behind it.

Taking his transmitter once more, Leo lets go of the gas pedal and flips a switch, the noise of the engine quickly cutting out as he announces over the transmitter to the other two squads. **"Eagle. Tiger. Switch mode from hydro to electric. We're approaching target."** Putting the transmitter on the dash, he hands his pistol to Dénis, nodding and gesturing him to have him check his pistol as he leads the approach to the warehouse.

With a gentle approach, the group of cars comes to a standstill right outside the main entrance of the warehouse. Raising his hand out of the window, Dénis signals the other two squads to exit the car, with Eagle staying behind as a guard and scout for the outside of the building, while Lion and Tiger would breach the building. Taking their bags, arming their rifles, they approach the door, heads held high and fearing nothing. 

With his pistol in his hand, finger levitating above the trigger, Leo prepares to breach the front door, pulling at the handle to check if it's locked and in need of a gunshot opening, but instead finding the door pushing inwards. *"What the... fuck?"* he mumbles to himself, giving Dénis a quick glance out of sheer confusion. **"Seems fishy to leave the door open."** he promptly replies, his finger above the trigger on his rifle too. **"Stay cautious."** Looking behind him, he signals Tiger to follow through as they breach through the front door, into the vast darkness of the warehouse.

With a quick scan of the walls and immense storage units packed with flowers and boxes, Dénis shakes his head, already seeing the end of the warehouse, yet discovering nothing of interest. He sighs deeply, the other three squad members continuing to look for a hint of life, or another door at all, but without hope. This seemed to be the wrong site altogether. Was this a prank on them by control? \
Taking his transmitter, he picks up a signal from Control, as he looks up to find a large, circular and stationary drone hovering quietly above the warehouse. His transmitter crackles with static as he reaches out for help from outside. **"Lion reporting. Warehouse is inconspicuous. Are you sure these were the right coordinates?"** \
*"Absolutely. There is a lot of activity on your location. Look to the sky, follow the drone, I will relocate the drone and track the entrance, I believe you'll need to go below ground."* \
The silence and eerie ambience of the warehouse was quickly disturbed by the loud whirring of the drone, its cloak having completely disappeared now as it travelled further into the warehouse, before its light blinks twice and returns to a stationary position, quickly disappearing soon afterwards. \
**"That's a straight up cartoon skit, I did not just watch that happen."** Mike from Tiger scoffs, being dumbfounded by how quickly the drone reappeared and disappeared, before slowly making his way towards its new location, feeling the ground begin to begone more hollow beneath him. **"Okay, seems the cartoon drone was right."**

### BREACH
Following Mike, the other three squad members also notice the floor becoming more hollow and loose before reaching the very corner of the building. Scanning and looking around, Leo finds an otherwise suspiciously well-maintained bouquet of flowers, having collected plenty of dust but still looking like they came off the fields just a day ago. *"This doesn't look right.."* he whispers to himself, lifting up the bouquet and finding a wire attached to the bottom, as the four hear a hatch open, revealing a large, metal stairwell, leading them at least 10 flights downwards into the ground. *"Easy enough.."* Leo laughs, taking a bag of weight from his bag and tying it to the bouquet of flowers, letting it hang from the shelf and keeping the hatch opened. 

**"Tiger to Control. We've found the entrance, seems to be 10 flights of stairs downwards. Signal might get bad down there, just a heads up."** Mike says through his transmitter before taking the first few steps downwards, hearing the metal frame of the stairwell creak beneath his weight as he takes his Energy Pistol in his hand, letting it warm up on the way down and have it ready for whatever might hide down there. \
*"Copy Tiger. We'll track you through the drone. Stay cautious and activate cams."* Is the reply from Control, indicating that communication might be hard but observance will stay stable. With a heavy breath, Leo follows the other three downwards, expecting the unexpected.

After what feels like an hour, the four reach the last flight of stairs, reaching another poorly-lit and unmarked entrance. With Leo taking the lead, he tries to enter the room in the same fashion that they entered the warehouse, but without luck this time around. Taking his pistol and holding the trigger, he feels the gun become slightly warm to the touch, as he aims at the lock in the door and fires a single shot, leaving a molten intend in the door and a slight creak - the facility was unlocked. **"Careful kids."** he said, cool as a cucumber, while he carefully opened the gates, **"Things might just get ugly from here."**

Weapons drawn, the four push forward into the facility, quickly lowering them upon finding out how poorly the facility is lit. Only backlights and functional lights were on, but there was no other source of illumination. The ceiling lights were present but turned off, but what especially irked Dénis was the lack of alarms. Was this place even secured at all? If these were really Leremkov's Labs, the Labs that were the source of the lockdowns through all of Kérisant, his home nation, or even the complete alteration of humanity as a species, wouldn't it make sense to secure it more properly than this? \
Shaking his head and getting back to his senses, he looks to his left to see Mike squinting his eyes, as if something had gotten into them. Giving him a quick pat on the shoulder to check up on him, Mike quickly replies and apologises for making him worry. **"'t's nothing, just the nasty fish smell"** he jokes, pulling his scarf over his mouth and nose to reduce the intoxicating smell for himself. 

A sudden noise echoes through the enormous hall, startling everyone but Leo, who continues to scan around and look through the facility. There were lots of giant see-through containers, and although they were very poorly lit, you could still easily see which colour the liquids inside them had. A light purple, to an almost poisonous green, and through a series of bronze pipes it would eventually reach a pool of colourless liquid. Separating the various containers and vials were seemingly abandoned desks with plenty of used breakers on them. **"Lots has happened here,"** Leo suddenly says, breaking the silence as his voice echoes through the facility, **"just wondering what led to this."**

Turning around is Emil, investigating the noise that shook him and the others, noticing that the door which they came through had closed behind them. Assuming it's nothing, he suggests splitting up the groups into individuals, giving all four of them enough time to dive deeper into logs and taking samples, but especially finding out just what went on right here.

With a slight nod to the other three, Dénis heads northeast, keeping his weapon at the ready while gazing deeply at the immense size of the vials and containers. *"This is absolutely ridiculous"* he mumbles to himself, in awe at just how enormous this whole facility was, at how much research and development went into this, but especially, the damage it did to his home nation. *"This wasn't just Leremkov, this had to be an insanely well-organised agency. A single man wouldn't be able to have this run by himself!"* \
Beneath him, something rattled, as he immediately takes his rifle and points it directly to the floor, realising it was just a breaker that he nearly tripped over. It seemed, unused, but he didn't trust it at all. There was something seriously off about this whole place. A facility of this capacity with such precision, it wouldn't make sense for someone to drop a breaker, and leave it be. Taking his glove and a bag, he carefully picks it up and puts it inside the bag, marking it as "EV_D1", before continuing to walk around and analyse the entire corner of the facility for evidence, sources, and plans. 


# Snippets
**// Snippet of Dénis acquiring and gaining access to a laptop, which he manages to hack his way into to obtain data** \
// Dénis will brute force his way into the laptop with a series of USBs that can force it into an unlimited amount of tries, as well as an unlimited amount of attempts (In 2075 computer speeds are this high, while security hasn't been too fantastic still). \
// Using another USB, he browses through various logs and documents, copying them onto another storage USB that he will use as evidence. On these logs, the closure of the labs is announced and executed. The facility was put into standby mode, for once a sudden return would have been needed. (This is after discovering that Leremkov fled to Poland, keeping a backdoor open back to the labs in Cévok. After BREACH, however, the labs were locked down, and this return no longer was possible, forcing Leremkov to stay in Poland until he is eventually found) 

**Snippet of Eagle spotting a series of cars approaching in the far distance (noise)** \
// In the far distance, Eagle, who were on scout and guarding duty, take notice of a series of cars approaching from the far distance. In distress, they alert Lion and Tiger, who were already making their way back to the trucks. \
// They had successfully collected evidence and data, and locked down the entrance to the facility so nobody else could enter and tamper with the evidence site. Locking down the warehouse, all three squads re-enter their trucks and take their leave well before the other cars arrive, warning Control of the situation, who then keeps the cloaked drone in position to see what will happen. \
// As it turns out, the series of cars skip past the warehouse, making the squadrons believe it was a false alarm. (Open end. Were they really just passerbys, or did an alarm go off after all?)
