# Leremkov Trials
Having completely spiralled out of control, much like the Leremkov virus itself, the development of this story is now in a separate entry altogether.

## Leremkov Trials
A broad definition and explanation of the Leremkov Trials is that Dr. Vitaly Leremkov altered human DNA over the span of 30 years, altering the DNA of a significant amount of humanity over this time, giving them animalistic traits, such as the sense of smell of a dog or antlers like a deer. Because "Leremkov Vaccines" quickly became a mouthful early on when often referring to people who were affected by them, it has become standard to refer to affected people as "People affected by Leremkov".

Much like Leremkov, stories that grow big enough and no longer end up fitting as drafts will end up in their own document. 

The Leremkov Trials as a whole is a big project. Below is a draft image of the content the Leremkov Trials had to mention.

## Vitaly Leremkov 
*Vitaly's complete story is available at [[Vitaly Leremkov, 2039-2098]].* \
Vitaly Leremkov, born in Sochi but having lived in Poznań for most of his life, was a biologist who specialized in genetics and DNA, using his knowledge for evil, rather than good, later on in his life, as he devoted the remaining years altering humanity's DNA in order to incorporate animal DNA and create a perfect blend, claiming he "desired a destiny like Þórirson".

## David & Stacy
The drafted story for David & Stacy has been extracted to [[Leremkov - PENDULUM]], as this will most likely be the story they will be included in.

## Vienna & Olen
Vienna & Olen are currently in a very small starting phase, being drafted not too long ago and only being properly documented as a side story to David & Stacy, and showing the effects and treatment of Leremkov from a medical standpoint, helping those who are affected by sharing their own experiences as affected people themselves.
### Who and who?
**Olen Rosenqvist**  
*Swedish* descent. Earth 2035.  
**Occupation**: Supervisor at Post-Leremkov treatment.  
**Brief description**: Olen was born and raised in Uppsala, Sweden, but moved together with his family to Kérisant when he was 12. Ever since, he had gained a growing passion for animals, frequently spending time at various community farms and on the plains of Cévok to help take care of the animals, as well as simply spending his time to peacefully rest together with them. At 19 years, he enrolled in the University of Kérisant, devoting the next few years of his life into animal health and treatment, eager to be a first responder to helping animals in need.
**Current role**: Rosenqvist was one of the first people to be affected by Leremkov, calling in sick for work one day in 2071, and waking up late in the evening with his ears in the wrong place, picking up all sorts of weird smells, and especially finding a dog's tail behind him. After a few weeks of adjusting, life surprisingly resumed to normal as he continues his job at the animal hospital and research area, before meeting Vienna one day in a similar situation. Together, they founded the first Leremkov Victim Centre division in the National Kérisantic hospital, giving aid and support to those affected by Leremkov and need guidance to adjust to their new bodies and roles. 
  
**Vienna Méckláz**  
*Kérisantic* descent. Luniks 2046.  
**Occupation**: Scientist, nurse, guardian, at Post-Leremkov treatment.
**Brief description**: Vienna was born as Julian in Weshalt, but has come out as transgender already in her early years of high school, where she then quickly found the role of a nurse appealing as a future job. Always having been a caring and careful person with a kind heart, she enrolled in Cévok College in 2065, and started to take serious steps in reaching her dream job. 
**Current role**: During an internship in her Master in 2071, she became affected by Leremkov after repeatedly coming in contact with others already affected, waking up completely disoriented as she gained various traits from an antelope. Despite this, she completed her Master and graduated, and instead agreed to devote her body to research into reducing the effects of Leremkov and experimenting if it was reversible in any way. These experiments instead ended up accelerating and worsening any changes still in stock for her, as she also gained the legs and hooves of an antelope, as well as her left shoulder and arm gaining a similar patterned fur. After this incident, she quickly learned how to adjust to her new role, as any further experiments were ruled out. With her new body, she stumbled upon Olen in 2071, and agreed to become a guardian and supportive person with the intent to aid those that underwent a similar, sudden change. 

### Planned story
We are following myself as a person who will receive aid from both Olen and Vienna after having been affected by Leremkov. I still have zero idea how big this project might become, nor how this story might unfold and develop, but given the scale it currently is at, it will definitely have its own separate entry. 

## Other scattered info
Once infected by Leremkov, it will take a few hours before the effects really become noticeable. During these hours, the virus becomes "hyperactive", as your skin might start irritating, your nose might become runny or you'll have intense coughing fits.  \
These coughing fits are vital in spreading the virus, and this is something Leremkov himself was keen on implementing when first creating this virus. The virus will float in the air or stick to surfaces as you cough or sneeze, and easily infect the next person to touch the now-infected item. This way, cities like Cévok and eventually Poznań would succumb to the immense speed the virus spread at.
