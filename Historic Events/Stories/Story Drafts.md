# Story Drafts
Much like the title suggests, these are drafts for the story surrounding Luniks as a whole. This project will be grand, and span a small percentage of all of Earth's history. Key points can be found in [[List of Historic Events]]. 

## Leremkov Trials
The Leremkov Trials have grown too big to remain a draft, and are now available at [[Leremkov Trials]]. This includes character information for [David & Stacy]([[Leremkov Trials#David & Stacy]]) and [Vienna & Olen]([[Leremkov Trials#Vienna & Olen]]).

### Vitaly Leremkov
Vitaly Leremkov's story has grown too big to remain a draft. It is now available at [[Vitaly Leremkov, 2039-2098]].

## PENDULUM
*This story draft is dependant on magic, described in [[Lore Concepts]]. This might not be a reality as the project nears completion, or it might be rewritten to adhere technology standards.*
PENDULUM is a non-profit organisation, founded in Mászdam in 2041, is an organisation that specializes in medical treatment through hypnotic treatment, hence the name "Pendulum". This organisation mostly came to be to help people deal with mental health and other issues, such as severe pain in their body and numbing it through hypnosis, but it's most notable for making people become content with their changed bodies after being affected by Leremkov's vaccines around 30 years later. 

The process in its most basic form would be to hypnotise and numb the person's mind, and using various doses of magic, they would make it so people would become at pure ease with their bodies, and in the case that instincts and/or behaviour was altered too, that a seamless blend between their old and new minds would take place. In some rare cases, where a vaccine left a person with an unfinished transformation (e.g. Only one of two ears being changed, one foot becoming a hoof while the other remains human, etc.), PENDULUM would also be able to use magic to forcefully transform the person according to their wishes, and in some cases they would even be able to completely revert the effect of the vaccine, given that it was treated quickly enough. This, however, brought risks with it, and this treatment in particular is not recommended.

Their most common treatment is adjusting a family tree according to the changes and effects on one person in their family tree. If a parent would be affected by the vaccine and gain traits of a fox, their partner could request a similar, controlled change, so that genetic defects would be almost eliminated for their future children. This is what Stacy's parents had undergone, after Stacy's mother was affected by Leremkov's vaccine, her father chose to undergo this treatment so that their future children, such as Stacy, wouldn't be born with genetic defects.
### Connecting PENDULUM with David & Stacy
Both PENDULUM and David have deep interest in researching and potentially curing or helping people with dealing with altered DNA from Leremkov. During David's graduation assignment, he meets Stacy and learns her story and her family, and gradually learns more about the Leremkov Vaccines in the process. As described above, Stacy's father had close contact with PENDULUM and even agreed to have his DNA altered to match his partner's. As David gets to know Stacy more closely, he might ask her father about PENDULUM and then get into contact with them in order to progress his own research.


## Oslo Revolution
The Oslo Revolution originally happened in 2247, and was first drafted in 2018 in the so-called "Alva-Line project", which has evolved countless times into where we are today with the Luniks project. Putting away the worries of repurposing the entire project and events in 2247 in Oslo, all I'd like to note here is that this will eventually happen! As of right now, the main planning is to properly note down the main outline of the project and the main timeline of Luniks, and slowly but surely Oslo will gain it's time and place where it will finally fall, as Nóve Osló doesn't have a similar reason for existence like Nóve Réjkjavik.


## Máneá-Zakh'háfo Conflict / Collapse of United Máneá
The title should be read as cause -> effect. The sudden split between Mánea and Zakh'háfo caused not only Zakh'háfo to crumble into economical and political discourse and instability, this also opened up doors to provinces and areas which were located between the two newly-formed countries to fight for their own independence too, most notably being Rhódiś. 
### Máneá-Zakh'háfo conflict
Note: This is part of a draft first made in 2020, and might contain content that no longer exists, or never properly existed. It might be highly inaccurate within the present state of the project.

*"4th century since Linuksian calendar was put into practise. End of united territories on Mánéa continent. Leaving behind devastation, the Zachháfon territories are too little to be able to regain economic development, causing a depression. Soon after the empire pulls out of Mánéa, the Union of Three (Kérisánt, Ellíttróómi, and the Mónsan Republic) declare war on Thórirsánt. This event also causes the Kérisántic revolution, ultimately leading to the disbanding of the Union of Three."*

- *Zachháfon economic crisis (AL 447 - 468)*
- *Mánéan splitting (AL 448)*

A few things to note: The **Luniksan calendar** only existed as a draft in the past, and no longer exists as a concept as Luniks continued using the internationally recognised Gregorian calendar. The **"Empire"** refers to the Thórirsantic Empire. This too, has been off the drawing board since 2021 and no longer exists as a concept given the change of pace and vision of the project, focusing on unification between nations on the planet, rather than full-scale conflict. The **Union of Three**, specifically the **Mónsan Republic**, no longer exist. The Union of Three was repurposed into an economic union between Thórirsant, Kérisant, and United Máneá, later becoming a union with Álusken instead of Máneá, before the idea of an economic union was scrapped completely. The only surviving part of this text is the **Mónsan Republic**, which remains a concept with a blank history and no location on the map, however, this is still planned.

### Collapse of United Máneá
There's currently no proper date for when United Máneá is officially declared and recognised as a split nation. The Luniksan calendar would suggest that this takes place in Anno Luniks 447, which would be roughly 480 years after the colonisation of Luniks. This would take a very long time, and with existing characters interacting with others that live around the late 21st century, the Collapse of Máneá will probably take place around the year 2090-2100 mark. 

United Máneá will break apart into Máneá, Zakh'háfo, Rhódisz (disputed).


## Álusken's Mysteries
Álusken's Mysteries has grown too big to remain a draft. It's now available at [[Álusken's Mysteries]].


## Hédenis
As Hédenis lays closely to Álusken, its mysteries and secrets, as well as the weird events that occur in Álusken, slowly but surely flow over to Hédenis as well. One major difference between the two nations is that Hédenis has a very open and philosophical approach to these events, whereas Álusken is very closed-off and secretive. The fact that Hédenis has such an open approach to these mysteries allows them to more quickly get used to them, and normalize these events as well, as they were quicker to learn the root cause (Deviations of Leremkov), and more quickly allowed the people that were affected to still be able to live an otherwise "normal" life in Hédenis. 


## GHOST TEMPLES
GHOST TEMPLES has grown too big to remain a draft. It's now available at [[GHOST TEMPLES]].
