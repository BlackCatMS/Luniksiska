# Story Drafts
Much like the title suggests, these are drafts for the story surrounding Luniks as a whole. This project will be grand, and span a small percentage of all of Earth's history. Key points can be found in [[List of Historic Events]]. 

## Leremkov Trials
The Leremkov Trials have grown too big to remain a draft, and are now available at [[Leremkov Trials]]. The info on the characters is now available at its corresponding [[Historic Events/Leremkov Trials/Character List|Character List]].

### Vitaly Leremkov
Vitaly Leremkov's story has grown too big to remain a draft. It is now available at [[Vitaly Leremkov, 2039-2095]].

### PENDULUM
Though part of the **Leremkov Trials**, the *PENDULUM* entry has grown too big to remain a draft and is now available at [[PENDULUM]].

### BREACH
*BREACH* is an in-depth look at how **Dénis Terczekv** infiltrated Leremkov's secret *Genetic Labs*, where he produced the vaccine that cause the irreversible damage to humanity's genes and DNA. Currently (December 2023), this is still in its starting phase, but will be gradually developed into its own entry, available at [[BREACH]].


## Oslo Revolution
The Oslo Revolution originally happened in 2247, and was first drafted in 2018 in the so-called "Alva-Line project", which has evolved countless times into where we are today with the Luniks project. Putting away the worries of repurposing the entire project and events in 2247 in Oslo, all I'd like to note here is that this will eventually happen! As of right now, the main planning is to properly note down the main outline of the project and the main timeline of Luniks, and slowly but surely Oslo will gain it's time and place where it will finally fall, as Nóve Osló doesn't have a similar reason for existence like Nóve Réjkjavik.

Further development on the **OSLO REVOLUTION** will be available at [[OSLO REVOLUTION]].


## Máneá-Zakh'háfo Conflict / Collapse of United Máneá
The title should be read as cause -> effect. The sudden split between Máneá and Zakh'háfo caused not only Zakh'háfo to crumble into economical and political discourse and instability, this also opened up doors to provinces and areas which were located between the two newly-formed countries to fight for their own independence too, the most notable of which being Rhódisz. 
### Máneá-Zakh'háfo conflict
Note: This is part of a draft first made in 2020, and might contain content that no longer exists, or never properly existed. It might be highly inaccurate within the present state of the project.

*"4th century since Linuksian calendar was put into practise. End of united territories on Mánéa continent. Leaving behind devastation, the Zachháfon territories are too little to be able to regain economic development, causing a depression. Soon after the empire pulls out of Mánéa, the Union of Three (Kérisánt, Ellíttróómi, and the Mónsan Republic) declare war on Thórirsánt. This event also causes the Kérisántic revolution, ultimately leading to the disbanding of the Union of Three."*

- *Zachháfon economic crisis (AL 447 - 468)*
- *Mánéan splitting (AL 448)*

A few things to note: The **Luniksan calendar** only existed as a draft in the past, and no longer exists as a concept as Luniks continued using the internationally recognised Gregorian calendar. The **"Empire"** refers to the Thórirsantic Empire. This too, has been off the drawing board since 2021 and no longer exists as a concept given the change of pace and vision of the project, focusing on unification between nations on the planet, rather than full-scale conflict. The **Union of Three**, specifically the **Mónsan Republic**, no longer exist. The Union of Three was repurposed into an economic union between Thórirsant, Kérisant, and United Máneá, later becoming a union with Álusken instead of Máneá, before the idea of an economic union was scrapped completely. The only surviving part of this text is the **Mónsan Republic**, which remains a concept with a blank history and no location on the map, however, this is still planned.

### Collapse of United Máneá
There's currently no proper date for when United Máneá is officially declared and recognised as a split nation. The Luniksan calendar would suggest that this takes place in Anno Luniks 447, which would be roughly 480 years after the colonisation of Luniks. This would take a very long time, and with existing characters interacting with others that live around the late 21st century, the Collapse of Máneá will probably take place around the year 2090-2100 mark. 

United Máneá will break apart into Máneá, Zakh'háfo, and Rhódisz.

// **March 2024 Update**: United Máneá collapses in **2039**. This gives every event that happens afterwards an easy opportunity to connect properly to the two collapsed nations that follow the collapse of the united nation, as well as giving it a more realistic timescale to connect to **GHOST TEMPLES** and **Nikec Krámisz's** involvement in both aforementioned story, as well as the connection with **Travel Risk**. 


## Álusken's Mysteries
Álusken's Mysteries has grown too big to remain a draft. It's now available at [[Álusken's Mysteries]].

## The Myths of Vao
Within Vao reign myths that have stood place for many decades since the establishment of Vao soon after Vao was settled. The most basic way to describe the myths are through the **Dragons of Vao**, and the **Aurora**, both of which are frequently mentioned in older scriptures in unison. It's believed that the *Dragons* dance through the mountains at night while the nation sleeps, and their shimmering colours of their scales and fire reflect into the night sky, causing the *Aurora* to appear and shine brightly. 

### Drafted Story: A direct descendant 
*// Context:* This is a drafted story that takes place in *Estre Donnore* in **Vao**. Although falling under **Álusken's Mysteries**, the actual mysteries take place outside Álusken as well, such as in the southwestern areas of Vao. The mixture of dragon myths and supernaturalism that are present in Vao and Álusken, respectively, create exceptionally odd supernatural situations in northeastern Álusken and southwestern Vao. \
*// POV: Unnamed Character*

With a quiet knock on the wooden door before me, I peek through the little window embedded within it, spotting a faint shadow at the end of the hall raising their hand in an effort to reach out to me. **"Wait just a tad!"** The voice echoes through the hall, muffled behind the thick door before me, as I awkwardly look around me, waiting for time to pass quickly. I look around the house, seeing through the window in the door that the person down the hall was putting something around her arms, wrapping something around it. thinking nothing of it, I turn to my right and look into the living room, seeing various oil paintings, all traditional and somewhat abstract art of the cultures that are prominent in Vao. Having been raised in Álusken myself, I never had proper exposure to the deeply rooted culture that was so prominent in Vao. The artworks were oddly mesmerising, the mixture and blends of colours, these should be stored in a museum, so why are they not?

The door suddenly opens before me, immediately snapping me out of my trance that I found myself in. Shaking my head to get back into focus, I immediately apologise and enter the little house.

--- interim because i cant come up with something for filler lmfao

*"I'm sorry-"* I suddenly ask, interrupting Estre from finishing her story, *"I have to ask. Your arms are covered up completely, are you in pain?"* \
With a deep sigh, Estre rests her hands flat on the table. **"Pain is a strong word, it's hard to explain."** She replies quietly, beginning to peel off a part of the leather wraps she has around her right arm. Staring deeply at her hands as she carefully removes the wraps, I expect to see bruised and damaged skin, but instead seeing a blueish, colourfully decorated hand appear under the otherwise grey leather that covered it. **"It's not frostbite, before you ask."** Estre mutters quietly, giving off a very uncomfortable feeling as more of her arm is slowly revealed to me. Next to the blue colour that covered her entire arm, patterns of yellow and white began to appear as well, with my first thought being the flag of Vao, and just how similar the tones are. *"It's.. mesmerising.. I'm sorry if it's rude to stare."* I apologise right away, doing my best to not come off as a creep of some sorts, but showing genuine interest. \
**"It runs in the family.**


## Hédenis
As Hédenis lays closely to Álusken, its mysteries and secrets, as well as the weird events that occur in Álusken, slowly but surely flow over to Hédenis as well. One major difference between the two nations is that Hédenis has a very open and philosophical approach to these events, whereas Álusken is very closed-off and secretive. The fact that Hédenis has such an open approach to these mysteries allows them to more quickly get used to them, and normalise these events as well, as they were quicker to learn the root cause (Deviations of Leremkov), and more quickly allowed the people that were affected to still be able to live an otherwise "normal" life in Hédenis. 


## GHOST TEMPLES
**GHOST TEMPLES** has grown too big to remain a draft, and is now available at [[GHOST TEMPLES]].

## TRAVEL RISK 
**TRAVEL RISK** has grown too big to remain a draft, and is now available at [[TRAVEL RISK]].
### Focus one: Civil unrest in Deth-Kelétam
This specific draft is now available at [[TRAVEL RISK#FOCUS ONE LUCKY WATER]].



# Other various smaller ideas
## Repurposing of Oslo Revolution (Alva-Line project)
Back in 2018, when I originally had the idea of making my own futuristic story, the planet of Luniks was then still a side story. Ever since, the original *Alva-Line Project*, as it was then called, dissipated in favour of the development of the planet Luniks (Originally called *Linux*) and its countries, languages, and every small detail and event it would bring with it. Since then, it has been rolled over various times and the original time scale that I had in mind (With an *Anno Luniks* calendar) quickly began to become too loosely coupled to still make sense.

All in all, the original Oslo Revolution was caused by the invasion of the now-returning **Alva Division**, who had escaped to colonize Luniks and returned to re-colonize Earth, using as much brutal force as they might have needed. The newly founded **Omega Division** would do all they could to prevent this from escalating and breaking out in a full-scale war. The third and final division that I had created before abandoning this aspect of the project, was the **Union of the Free**, who provided shelter and tried to escape the unavoidable war that was about to occur. This all, of course, is far too unrelated to present day Luniks. 

My goal, or plan, is to repurpose the Oslo Revolution and downscale the size of the "Revolution". In a future planned world where I try to keep conflicts at al all time low (barring the **Máneá-Zakh'háfo conflict**), meaning the outbreak of a full-scale war doesn't sit right on the time scale nor state of society I try to describe. A possible future for this particular topic for me would probably be a revolution rallying for independence of the state that Oslo is present within, leading to smaller incidents similar to the **2075 Keustellet Terrorist attacks**, which don't escalate into civil war. 

## The Kágos Núje Legacy
**Kágos Núje** (2018: *Kágos Nûje*) is a characterless name that has been floating around without a goal since drafts dating back to 2018. My end goal is to finally implement this name in *any* story, where it will most likely become a highly notable character, hence the **Legacy** preposition. Whether this will happen within *The Leremkov Trials*, *Ghost Temples*, or a yet-to-happen story, is still unclear!

## Unspecified conflict scenarios
// Oslo Revolution *might* fall under this as well, as well as the drafted *Kágos Núje Legacy*. 

Building onwards from **TRAVEL RISK**, I feel like more in-depth scenarios could be drafted as well, shining a light on certain characters that might be important to that story, and may also play a major and/or minor role in other stories. I still struggle to properly describe this idea, but it could open up the door to a lot of different and completely new stories that haven't been drafted yet!

## Early Drafted Álusken's Mysteries additions
I've additionally been thinking of adding supernaturalism in one form or another to the existing story of **Álusken's Mysteries**, giving additional roles to *Matthias-Eden* and shining a proper light on the vast difference between the capital city and surrounding cities such as *Keustellet* and *Ippavím*. Additionally, I'd like to introduce more small towns within Álusken as well that might gain a connection to **GHOST TEMPLES** as well, but the future will need to tell, and especially what I will come up with within this addition!

I've been drafting a strange, central spot in the middle of the country of Álusken, which is seemingly "possessed" by an unnatural force of some sorts, which can explain the other various mysteries that occur within the nation and can be connected to **GHOST TEMPLES** as well. This will need proper additions, though, and is very subject to change because of the lack of depth as of right now! (January 2024).

Next to this (March 2024) is a draft that includes the nation of **Vao**, and its known history with the myths of dragons that roamed its mountains and plains. With borders having shifted a few times since the original settlements on Vestia, were some natural borders crossed, and is **Vaon Dragon** territory actually on **Alusken**?

## Deep dive into the history of early Luniksan settlements


## Unnamed and unused draft
### Important note
This snippet of a story could be extracted into **Snow's Last Light**, which is available at [[LAST LIGHT#// SNOW]]. In that case, it will no longer be a draft, and not find a purpose elsewhere either.

**Update (March 2024)**: This snippet has been repurposed to an extent in **Snow's Last Light**. While this is the case, there is no mention of a reactor, or any explosion in rough detail, meaning this draft will survive after all and see a purpose in another story.


*// POV: Unnamed character* \
My ears continued ringing, smoke filled the room from the rubble that had collapsed on top of me. I struggled to make my way out of the pile I was buried under. Just what had gone wrong here? How did this even escalate as far as it has? The protocol seemed to progress just fine, we'd gone through 4 stages like we routinely have every week, and yet this time around, after 30 weeks, how come it failed now?

I coughed violently, trying to keep myself from inhaling the smoke that filled the room. I had no idea what was leaking, what the smoke might be from. Was it the rubble? Were it the pipes that had blown? The toxic fumes from the reactor? I didn't want to find out, and with all my might managed to crawl my way under the pile of rocks. My left calf was torn open, and the excessive amount of adrenaline surging through my body was the only thing keeping me from collapsing right here right now. With a shaky leg, I scanned myself and my surroundings, finding the roof having collapsed and electric arcs waving before me where the reactor once used to stand. My left arm was also severely injured, and I knew I had mere minutes left to find help, aware that if I failed to do so, I would collapse and that would be the end for me.
