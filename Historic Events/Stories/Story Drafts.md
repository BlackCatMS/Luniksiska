# Story Drafts
Much like the title suggests, these are drafts for the story surrounding Luniks as a whole. This project will be grand, and span a small percentage of all of Earth's history. Key points can be found in [[List of Historic Events]]. 

## Leremkov Trials
A broad definition and explanation of the Leremkov Trials is that Dr. Vitaly Leremkov altered human DNA over the span of 30 years, altering the DNA of a significant amount of humanity over this time, giving them animalistic traits, such as the sense of smell of a dog or antlers like a deer. Because "Leremkov Vaccines" quickly became a mouthful early on when often referring to people who were affected by them, it has become standard to refer to affected people as "People affected by Leremkov".

Much like Leremkov, stories that grow big enough and no longer end up fitting as drafts will end up in their own document. 

The Leremkov Trials as a whole is a big project. Below is a draft image of the content the Leremkov Trials had to mention.

### Vitaly Leremkov
Vitaly Leremkov's story has grown too big to remain a draft. It is now available at [[Vitaly Leremkov, 2039-2098]].

### David & Stacy
Background information: David is a student at the university in Antwerpen. This takes place around 20-25 after Leremkov's first series of DNA alterations in Cévok, Kerisant. Stacy is the daughter of two people affected by this DNA alteration, and has been born with this altered DNA. For his graduation, David researched the effects of the vaccinations from Leremkov on the human genome, learning that Stacy has been an indirect victim of this.

#### Drafted story
Spinning idly in his chair, David — a student scientist and biologist at the hospital in Antwerpen — twirled his pen through his fingers, deeply lost in thought with his paperwork right before him. A due date of October 30th in bold, red text up top. Looking up to the clock above his desk, he watches the seconds tick by before dropping his pen on the table, finally having found the determination to finish up his project.  
  
Turning the pages of his notebook, he suddenly pauses as he reads the name of someone familiar to him, Stacy Eweyck. Scanning the page quickly, his focus reaches its highest point as he reads "Leremkov" again and again, reading her symptoms, reading her attributes, but one thing stands out to him, as he whispers to himself out loud. "No vaccines, no contact, but birth-given?"  
  
David picked his pen back up, as he picks up a new sheet of paper. Slowly but surely he begins copying his own notes of her symptoms, her fox-like personality, her vibrant orange tail, her big and furry fox ears. Putting a line under "BORN THIS WAY" at the bottom of his newly created note, he steps out of his chair and sprints to his professor. If people can be born with these attributes, just how badly has Leremkov poisoned humanity?

#### What comes after?
My planned outline for this particular is story is that it will grow into a short novel of some sorts. David would gradually dive deeper into his research about the Leremkov vaccines, and during this process learn how Stacy lives her otherwise normal life with this vastly different strain of DNA. In the end, it'll probably end up being a cheesy romance story with a bit of mysterious vibes, but I expect it to remain nothing but drafts that loosely connect to one another. 

##### A first hand experience?
It might also be an idea for David to experience the vast difference between humanity as he knows it, and humanity as Stacy knows it, completely by himself. I purposely excluded the current year on David's due date for his work, meaning that this story could very well take place while Leremkov, or his namesake, to still be around and actively dose people. Keeping in mind that **David and Stacy are 22-24 years old** would mean that the story should take place around **2095-2098**.

### Vienna & Olen
Vienna & Olen are currently in a very small starting phase, being drafted not too long ago and only being properly documented as a side story to David & Stacy, and showing the effects and treatment of Leremkov from a medical standpoint, helping those who are affected by sharing their own experiences as affected people themselves.

#### Who and who?
**Olen Rosenqvist**  
*Swedish* descent. Earth 2035.  
**Occupation**: Supervisor at Post-Leremkov treatment.  
**Brief description**: Olen was born and raised in Uppsala, Sweden, but moved together with his family to Kérisant when he was 12. Ever since, he had gained a growing passion for animals, frequently spending time at various community farms and on the plains of Cévok to help take care of the animals, as well as simply spending his time to peacefully rest together with them. At 19 years, he enrolled in the University of Kérisant, devoting the next few years of his life into animal health and treatment, eager to be a first responder to helping animals in need.
**Current role**: Rosenqvist was one of the first people to be affected by Leremkov, calling in sick for work one day in 2071, and waking up late in the evening with his ears in the wrong place, picking up all sorts of weird smells, and especially finding a dog's tail behind him. After a few weeks of adjusting, life surprisingly resumed to normal as he continues his job at the animal hospital and research area, before meeting Vienna one day in a similar situation. Together, they founded the first Leremkov Victim Center division in the National Kerisantic hospital, giving aid and support to those affected by Leremkov and need guidance to adjust to their new bodies and roles. 
  
**Vienna Méckláz**  
*Kérisantic* descent. Luniks 2046.  
**Occupation**: Scientist, nurse, guardian, at Post-Leremkov treatment.
**Brief description**: Vienna was born as Julian in Weshalt, but has come out as transgender already in her early years of high school, where she then quickly found the role of a nurse appealing as a future job. Always having been a caring and careful person with a kind heart, she enrolled in Cévok College in 2065, and started to take serious steps in reaching her dream job. 
**Current role**: During an internship in her Master in 2071, she became affected by Leremkov after repeatedly coming in contact with others already affected, waking up completely disoriented as she gained various traits from an antelope. Despite this, she completed her Master and graduated, and instead agreed to devote her body to research into reducing the effects of Leremkov and experimenting if it was reversible in any way. These experiments instead ended up accelerating and worsening any changes still in stock for her, as she also gained the legs and hooves of an antelope, as well as her left shoulder and arm gaining a similar patterned fur. After this incident, she quickly learned how to adjust to her new role, as any further experiments were ruled out. With her new body, she stumbled upon Olen in 2071, and agreed to become a guardian and supportive person with the intent to aid those that underwent a similar, sudden change. 

#### Planned story
We are following myself as a person who will receive aid from both Olen and Vienna after having been affected by Leremkov. I still have zero idea how big this project might become, nor how this story might unfold and develop, but given the scale it currently is at, it will definitely have its own separate entry. 


## PENDULUM
*This story draft is dependant on magic, described in [[Lore Concepts]]. This might not be a reality as the project nears completion, or it might be rewritten to adhere technology standards.*
PENDULUM is a non-profit organisation, founded in Mászdam in 2041, is an organisation that specializes in medical treatment through hypnotic treatment, hence the name "Pendulum". This organisation mostly came to be to help people deal with mental health and other issues, such as severe pain in their body and numbing it through hypnosis, but it's most notable for making people become content with their changed bodies after being affected by Leremkov's vaccines around 30 years later. 

The process in its most basic form would be to hypnotise and numb the person's mind, and using various doses of magic, they would make it so people would become at pure ease with their bodies, and in the case that instincts and/or behaviour was altered too, that a seamless blend between their old and new minds would take place. In some rare cases, where a vaccine left a person with an unfinished transformation (e.g. Only one of two ears being changed, one foot becoming a hoof while the other remains human, etc.), PENDULUM would also be able to use magic to forcefully transform the person according to their wishes, and in some cases they would even be able to completely revert the effect of the vaccine, given that it was treated quickly enough. This, however, brought risks with it, and this treatment in particular is not recommended.

Their most common treatment is adjusting a family tree according to the changes and effects on one person in their family tree. If a parent would be affected by the vaccine and gain traits of a fox, their partner could request a similar, controlled change, so that genetic defects would be almost eliminated for their future children. This is what Stacy's parents had undergone, after Stacy's mother was affected by Leremkov's vaccine, her father chose to undergo this treatment so that their future children, such as Stacy, wouldn't be born with genetic defects.

### Connecting PENDULUM with David & Stacy
Both PENDULUM and David have deep interest in researching and potentially curing or helping people with dealing with altered DNA from Leremkov. During David's graduation assignment, he meets Stacy and learns her story and her family, and gradually learns more about the Leremkov Vaccines in the process. As described above, Stacy's father had close contact with PENDULUM and even agreed to have his DNA altered to match his partner's. As David gets to know Stacy more closely, he might ask her father about PENDULUM and then get into contact with them in order to progress his own research.


## Oslo Revolution
The Oslo Revolution originally happened in 2247, and was first drafted in 2018 in the so-called "Alva-Line project", which has evolved countless times into where we are today with the Luniks project. Putting away the worries of repurposing the entire project and events in 2247 in Oslo, all I'd like to note here is that this will eventually happen! As of right now, the main planning is to properly note down the main outline of the project and the main timeline of Luniks, and slowly but surely Oslo will gain it's time and place where it will finally fall, as Nóve Osló doesn't have a similar reason for existence like Nóve Réjkjavik.


## Máneá-Zakh'háfo Conflict / Collapse of United Máneá
The title should be read as cause -> effect. The sudden split between Mánea and Zakh'háfo caused not only Zakh'háfo to crumble into economical and political discourse and instability, this also opened up doors to provinces and areas which were located between the two newly-formed countries to fight for their own independence too, most notably being Rhódiś. 

### Máneá-Zakh'háfo conflict
Note: This is part of a draft first made in 2020, and might contain content that no longer exists, or never properly existed. It might be highly inaccurate within the present state of the project.

*"4th century since Linuksian calendar was put into practise. End of united territories on Mánéa continent. Leaving behind devastation, the Zachháfon territories are too little to be able to regain economic development, causing a depression. Soon after the empire pulls out of Mánéa, the Union of Three (Kérisánt, Ellíttróómi, and the Mónsan Republic) declare war on THórirsánt. This event also causes the Kérisántic revolution, ultimately leading to the disbanding of the Union of Three."*

- *Zachháfon economic crisis (AL 447 - 468)*
- *Mánéan splitting (AL 448)*

A few things to note: The **Luniksan calendar** only existed as a draft in the past, and no longer exists as a concept as Luniks continued using the internatially recognised Gregorian calendar. The **"Empire"** refers to the Thórirsantic Empire. This too, has been off the drawing board since 2021 and no longer exists as a concept given the change of pace and vision of the project, focusing on unification between nations on the planet, rather than full-scale conflict. The **Union of Three**, specifically the **Mónsan Republic**, no longer exist. The Union of Three was repurposed into an economic union between Thórirsant, Kerisant, and United Máneá, later becoming a union with Álusken instead of Máneá, before the idea of an economic union was scrapped completely. The only surviving part of this text is the **Mónsan Republic**, which remains a concept with a blank history and no location on the map, however, this is still planned.

### Collapse of United Máneá
There's currently no proper date for when United Máneá is officially declared and recognised as a split nation. The Luniksan calendar would suggest that this takes place in Anno Luniks 447, which would be roughly 480 years after the colonisation of Luniks. This would take a very long time, and with existing characters interacting with others that live around the late 21st century, the Collapse of Máneá will probably take place around the year 2090-2100 mark. 

United Máneá will break apart into Máneá, Zakh'háfo, Rhódiś (disputed).


## Álusken's Mysteries
Álusken's Mysteries has grown too big to remain a draft. It's now available at [[Álusken's Mysteries]].


## Hédenis
As Hédenis lays closely to Álusken, its mysteries and secrets, as well as the weird events that occur in Álusken, slowly but surely flow over to Hédenis as well. One major difference between the two nations is that Hédenis has a very open and philosophical approach to these events, whereas Álusken is very closed-off and secretive. The fact that Hédenis has such an open approach to these mysteries allows them to more quickly get used to them, and normalize these events as well, as they were quicker to learn the root cause (Deviations of Leremkov), and more quickly allowed the people that were affected to still be able to live an otherwise "normal" life in Hédenis.
