### Drafted Story
Roaming through the vivid and bright streets of Matéiazhu, hidden behind a mask and seen by nobody, is a young ghost. They lost their lives in a shock derailment incident on their way home from Zhuehai to Benelux, in the first deadly rail incident since the opening of the planetary rail network, at least 30 years prior. Ever since, they've been stuck in Zhuehai, forever longing to go home, but instead needing to find comfort behind a mask, roaming through the streets, eyeing every passerby, some familiars, mostly strangers. With their head down, they reach behind a corner store, taking a seat on top of the garbage collector, their hand resting on their cheek as they stare into the busy street. Every single night has passed like this. Staring at the busy street, eager and desperate to join the masses, but just being invisible to everyone, hidden behind a mask.  \
*"Is everything alright? You look exhausted.."* a young voice suddenly sounds behind them. Shockingly, they turn around, now facing a girl of about 19 years old, gazing deeply into their eyes. Completely taken aback by the situation, they stare back, their voice long gone as the girl gradually grows impatient. *"I don't have all day, I can help if you want me to"*.  \
Struggling to find the right words, knowing they last spoke a word all those years ago on the train, they lift their hand, pointing at the girl. **"You can.. see me?**" They ask, a raspy, distinct, yet slightly digitalized voice coming from behind the mask. In response, the girl nods, her already low amount of fear and doubt dropping to the floor as she draws closer, analysing the ghost's mask. *"You have a mesmerizing mask, it's so delicate.. Is it handmade?"* She tenderly asks, making clear she means no harm in the slightest.  \
**"It's.. old.. but made by myself."** The ghost mutters back, slowly regaining their long lost comfort in speaking, as they loosen up as well, gradually gaining trust in this mysterious girl before him. "I must know", they start, as they slowly drop down from the garbage collector, **"How are you able to see me? You are the first in years, this should be impossible."**  \
Instead of directly answering the question, the curious girl continues to overanalyse the ghost's mask, eager to point out smaller details, finding a crescent moon mark, the emblem of Vestia, and the symbol of Jérrat, beautifully integrated into the mask's white and gold colourway. Suddenly, she breaks the now minute-long silence, carefully looking into their eyes. *"It's strange. I've seen you around more often, as well as other masked people. I thought everyone systematically ignored you, but if I'm alone in being able to see you..-"*  \
The ghost suddenly interrupts, with their hand on their chest, gripping tightly on their suit. **"I've seen other ghosts. An Ox's mask, a Fox's mask, oddest of all, a broken mask of a Deer. If you've seen them too, it must be a sign. It must mean something."**  \
Nodding slowly, the girl's confidence seems to stagger as her eyes now face the floor, eyeing the ghost's shoes, but not in detail. Speaking softly, she gradually looks back up to face the ghost's mask. *"I've been meaning to ask, but if I may, what is your name?"*  \
A shiver runs through the ghost's phantom body, as flashbacks suddenly race through their mind. A vision of the train, a vision of family, all sorts of familiar faces, familiar places, seemingly so far away, as words and names refuse to formulate and connect. Raising their hand to their face, they once more struggle to collect words, before finally looking back into the girls eyes, responding confidently and clearly.  \
**"I am the Ghost of Luna. For now, that is all that matters."**

### What's next?
For **EXPOSURE // LUNA**, the main approach is following the Ghost of Luna through their story and describe their experience as a ghost, starting from the very moment of the rail incident in Zhuehai, all the way towards the complete connection of temples spread throughout the planet, maybe even hinting at temples located back at Earth?

This is a very bold and rough draft because I struggle to properly put it to words and have it flow nicely into an actual story. Nevertheless, this is exciting to me because it showcases one of Snow's personal strengths, rather than her weaknesses.  

### Drafted Story
*POV: Ghost of Snow*  \
**// This section needs expansion before the existing text.**  \
Suddenly, my silence is broken as I hear a series of footsteps approach me, their sound getting louder and louder with each step as my ears perk upright, facing to my back, tracing the sound. My heart begins to pound in my chest, as I decide to stay put. *"Surely I'm imagining things, no?"* I ask myself, every single possibility rushing through my mind as I try to crack the code as to who might be stepping towards me. Do they know I'm here? Have then seen me? *Can* they see me?  
  
The footsteps quiet down, having stopped right behind my back, the stranger's warmth radiating against my tail as I do my best to keep myself upright and cautious, still having no idea what might happen next, before hearing one last step taken forward. From pure instinct, I felt like the stranger was reaching their hand out to touch me. In the blink of an eye, I turn around, my right hand coated in a blue, waving fire as I reach for the stranger's neck, keeping it in place and neutralizing them while the world around me vanishes, leaving behind an empty, barren, and glowing white wasteland with just me and the stranger left.  
  
My eyes glow with fury, the same fire that's present on my arm also resides in my eyes and on the tip of my tail, completely altering my appearance as strength continues to pulse through my body, fully aware that there are no other people not structures that can eavesdrop on me and this stranger.  
  
After what feels like hours, my strength already dissipates, my grip gradually releases and leaves the stranger before me gasping for air. The fire in my eyes and arms vanishes as calmness behind to flow through my body, followed by a blend of confusion, fear, but determination to figure out what exactly is going on. *"I-I'm so terribly sorry! I had no idea! I was afraid, got overly cautious, and now.."* I stumble helplessly, emotions rushing through my body upon seeing the slight burn mark left on their throat. My ears flop down on my head in pure despair as the stranger before me regains their breath, and manages to find their voice. **"Quite the scare, it was."** They say politely and calmly, coughing to free up their airways before continuing. **"It's Márten, Junior Temple Guardian. It may look bad, but worry not, I've gone through worse Signatures and I'm still here to tell those tales."**
