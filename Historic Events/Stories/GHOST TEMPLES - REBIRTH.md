# GHOST TEMPLES // REBIRTH

**Rebirth** refers to the rebirth of those that died in accidents of no fault of their own, and were granted another chance to live through the process of rebirth, granted by a Temple Guardian. In standard cases, Temple Guardians choose the most pure souls that were robbed of the proper, long life that they deserved and died too soon in an accident or circumstance they had no control over. This includes accidents like the **2074 Matéiazhu Rail Disaster**, and the **2075 Keustellet Terrorist attacks**, where the Ghosts of *Luna* and *Snow* lost their lives, respectively. 

Upon rebirth, a newly born Ghost is introduced to their new Guardian, that will introduce them to their new life and explain in a light amount of detail what had happened to them in their past one. As all Ghosts struggle with amnesia, where all memories but the Last Light rapidly vanish upon rebirth, this means it will both be easy yet hard for them to adapt to their new lives.

### Drafted Story
*POV: Ghost of Luna*

*"The deafening sounds of everything collapsing had passed, I felt like I lost the ability to hear, to see, to feel. Had I died? What happened? I remember the train, the derailing, the crash. I must have died, haven't I?..."* \
**"As painful as it is to say, yes, you have."** \
Dumbfounded to hear a reply at all, I try to reopen my eyes, struggling to gain focus of the figure before me, or focus on anything at all. My ears began to ring again as the visions of the moments just before the train derailment begin to replay in my mind, before gradually burning up and vanishing as soon as they appear. The figure before me was vibrant white. A black and white mantle, a snow white mask, wearing a hood, so curious...  \
Before long, I finally manage to focus my eyesight again as the figure before me becomes clearer, much like the scene surrounding them. Everything seemed familiar, I recognized the different platforms, I recognized the ceiling and the unique lights that hung around here at this time of the year. Until suddenly it clicked, and I looked to my left. My eyes opening wide, everything immediately flashed back to me. I didn't just find myself in Matéiazhu, nor just at the train station. It was far worse. I found myself at the scene of the accident, with the fateful train right beside me. In shock, I turn back to the figure before me, struggling to keep my emotions under control as everything begins to fall apart in my mind. \
*"W-what's going on?"* \
**"Beside you is a VR20, or what's left of it. You had boarded this train, with good faith, but a power failure led to this accident, and the loss of your pure life."** \
"Pure life?" This was too much to handle for me. Even though I used to excel in strange and supernatural conditions, this was outrageous. This was way beyond anything I could ever have imagined. I started to grow more annoyed. I needed to know where I was, I needed to understand what happened and what will happen next, but as I tried to stand up, I was interrupted once more by the white-masked man before me.
**"Do not exert yourself. I am here to help. As sudden as this might be, I am here to help"**
He reached out his hand to me, showing no signs of hostility whatsoever, as I was conflicted in my emotions yet again.

### Drafted Story
*POV: Ghost of Snow

I woke up feeling sore and cold all over, my body felt out of place, but I couldn't lay a finger on what exactly was wrong, the first things I noticed were that the market had been abandoned, filled to the brim with lingering clouds of dust, as if a bomb had gone off; the roof had collapsed near the central aisles, which would explain the cold breeze I was feeling.  \
I slowly tried to move myself upwards, getting more and more accustomed with my shifted body, knowing I'm the same person as I was before, yet also, having no idea where, or rather when, I am. My memories slowly started to seep back in my mind, but as hard as I tried to form a picture of what happened, of who I was, more and more holes began to appear in the picture in my mind, as if it was actively being erased, as if I was forgetting my past right in this very moment. \
Gripping myself on the shelves, I slowly and carefully work my way upright, my legs wobbling as I breathe roughly, coughing often from the dust cloud lingering through the entire market. Slowly looking around, I see right away where I am, the exact same aisle, the exact same place, as where I last saw myself before fainting. But yet again, my vision blurs, colours fade, and as quickly as I begin to remember where I am, I begin to forget.

Groaning softly, I fall back to the floor and move my hand to my forehead, feeling it throb as blood surges through my body as I gradually come to be. A vision repeatedly pulses through my mind, an image of a formally dressed, masked man, black shirt, white robe, a mask completely covering his face, white..\
**"It appears you have awoken, young ghost."** \
A voice booms through the market, echoing off every wall as I turn my head upwards, facing the strange figure that I just pictured in my mind right before me. Millions of questions come to me right away, but none exit my mouth as I only manage to let out a soft gasp, feeling like I'm unable to speak, as if I'm silenced by the strange aura emitted by the figure before me. \
**"Speaking is not advised. It appears you have died."** He says without emotion. Through his mask, I can feel his eyes stare deeply into mine, my body shivering as I now feel completely helpless, completely lost. Feeling tears already begin to build up as every emotion rushes through my mind, from fear to confusion, to anger and sadness, he opens his robe, and reveals a mask. \
**"This will help you speak. Please understand and put it on."** \
Carefully taking the mask from his hand, I study it deeply. A plain, white mask with fox characteristics, especially with its enormous tipped ears. Gulping as I wipe the tears I tried to hide away, I put on the mask, feeling a new stream of energy and warmth instantly stream through my body as I reopen my eyes, gazing upwards at the mysterious figure before me, trying to scramble together the right words. \
*"What's.. going on?"* \
**"I am the Settler of Vászi. You are the Ghost of Snow. Together, we are part of the Temple of Vestia. I understand this is a lot of information to take in at once, for that, I'm sorry"** \
Finishing his words, Vászi carefully bows in an apologetic manner, his robe delicately wrapping around him in a protective manner, almost as if it's a defensive manoeuvre. In response, I crawl upwards, my legs continuing to wobble, now fully aware of the situation I, and my body, are in, while more and more information seeps into my mind from the mask. Catching my breath and readying my words, I prepare myself for the worst of answers. \
*"Vászi, if I may ask, what.. happened?"* \
Without hesitation, the Settler takes a step forward to put a hand on my shoulder, his other hand revealing a copy of an ID card, and flips it around, revealing a small mirror, which in turn reveals my face, mismatching the pictured face on the ID card, as I feel a cold shiver run through my body upon realisation. \
**"On October 4th, 2075, a missile struck the market you find yourself in. At the same time, criminals entered through the North and South sides to plunder and raid the market. Ever since, it has been left vacant. We were not able to rescue your body, but we rescued your soul, and gave you another chance in the body that matches your soul."** \
A chill runs through my spine, and an everlasting moment of silence begins between us. My body had felt odd from the very second I had reawakened, and the glimpse I got of myself in the mirror fully explained why. Moving my hands to my face, I carefully take off the mask, feeling a cold breeze enter my lungs as I take a deep breath, struggling to keep my head high, to keep my emotions beside me for the time being. After what feels like hours, I finally find the strength to stand up, as I stare before me, Vászi's arm extended, feeling his eyes gaze deeply at mine through his mask once more, but feeling a much more inviting, a much more pleasant warmth this time around. Taking his hand, I try to speak, but get cut short, still struggling to speak without wearing my mask, and being interrupted by Vászi. \
**I'm terribly sorry that you had lost your previous life, and I understand your new form is vastly different. I will make a promise: I will guide you, and I will guard you, for I am your Guardian from now on.**

### Drafted Story
*POV: Ghost of Raine*

With a deep sigh, I picked the jar of pasta sauce from the cabinet in the supermarket. I personally despised making myself pasta, but with guests coming over, I had to please the guests as well, knowing that Michael surely wouldn't mind me going outside of my comfort box with dinner. A few steps northbound, I headed to the meat section of the store, taking a simple box of ground beef, betting on having some left over beef to treat myself and Michael with something special, just for the two of us. From the thought alone, my cheeks turn into a deep red, imagining all the things I could make, the smile on his face as he would take his first bite, oh, how romantical!

But it wasn't until I reached the last aisle that I started to realise things were off. Taking a wine bottle off the shelf as the cherry on the cake, I saw something off in the centre of my eye. Colours were starting to get more muted, the noise of the crowd within the supermarket began to fade out. The combined noise of every customer chatting in a casual, friendly way with the others, began to rapidly fade into the same sound. 

*"Is what you see real?"* I suddenly heard a voice say right behind me, causing me to nearly drop the bottle of wine I was holding out of pure fear. With a gulp, I turn around, ready for the worst, but ultimately seeing, nothing? The voices started to echo around me, from every direction, as I quickly placed the bottle back on the shelf. *"Are you paying attention?"* I felt my heard pounding in my chest, fear reaching levels I never knew it could reach. *"Do not be afraid"*, the voices began to whisper. *"Your help is here."* I began to frantically look around, trying to find out if this was an elaborate prank being pulled on me. *"Czu onan visés?"* Trying to speak, to yell out, I find my voice lost from the sheer amount of fear and anxiety rushing through my veins, as the voices start to repeat the same thing, again and again. *"Fear not, Raine."*

My eyes fixate on the main entrance of the small supermarket, right behind the checkout section, where a cloaked figure had appeared. My fear reached even higher levels than before, the strange figure gradually making their way towards me, showing no intent of stopping, but weirdly enough, no intent of harm either. The colours began to fade completely, until every colour became a mixture of greyscale and muted, dark colours. White fog began to fill the supermarket, sending chills through my body, before realising it was beginning to rain. I suddenly heard the steps of the figure before me, his appearance becoming more clear to me, even despite the lack of colour. But that didn't matter, they were wearing a black harness, a bright, white mantle, and a creepy, plain white mask. Before realising it would be impossible to rain inside a supermarket, the steps stopped, as the figure stood still, reaching their hand out, and breaking the silence.

**"Please, do not be afraid. I am here to guide you through this, Raine."**

With the lump still well and present high up in my throat, I do my best to swallow it away, failing in the process. Keeping myself from coughing violently, I take a deep breath, and finally decide to reach out my hand towards the creepy white figure before me, managing to spurt out a few words as I gently hold his hand, as careful as I can be. \
*"Y-you.. won't kill me.. right..?"* \
**"I'm afraid we're already past that stage. I'm here to grant you a second chance at life."**

An ice cold breeze immediately rushed throughout the supermarket, the rain becoming even colder, with his words echoing through the aisles and walls. "Past that stage"? Just what was this guy on? Every single thought dashed across and through my head. Had I died? When? How? Just what happened? Is this a joke, was this an out of season prank? I had a bad relationship with the neighbours two doors down, but this would be out of this world, even for them! \
Doing my absolute best to keep my tears at bay, keeping myself from panicking or collapsing under my fears, I whisper under my breath, my eyes tracing down from the luminescent mask, down to his pitch-black harness. \
*"W-what..?"*

Without hesitation the figure before me replies, and begins to explain. His tone of voice stayed the same; Cold and otherwise emotionless, but oddly warm, as if he really intended to help me through this. As he began to speak, I tried to go through every memory I had made in my life, but struggling to properly picture them before me. The first kiss with Michael, meeting his parents for the first time, all the way to our honeymoon, but as I envisioned every memory, I quickly began to realise that that would be my last ever time seeing those memories. The colours began to mute and grey out, before the pictures themselves began to burn away, holes forming, before the entire memory would be burned away from my mind, lost in the infinite sea of thoughts.

**"There is no easy way for me to say this, Raine. You had just been assassinated, wrongly. You looked identical to a Mafia target. The shooter had misjudged."** \
*"S-so.. now..?"* \
**"It means you were killed wrongly, and it wouldn't be right for us to let your life go to waste like this."** 

With a quick, but careful motion, he takes his left hand and slowly presses it on his mask. Within a second, the mask lets go, as he brings it down, revealing his face to me, a warm, inviting smile having been kept hidden behind the mask. The rain in the supermarket quickly came to a stop, the white mist that had formed slowly began to dissipate, as I felt a strange, and especially mysterious ray of warmth encompass me while tears began to stream down my cheeks. A mixture of hope and grief rushing through my blood. 

**"My name is Sóvis, the Guardian of the Temple of Vestia. I'd like to guide you through this sudden change, Raine, you are deserving of this second life."**
