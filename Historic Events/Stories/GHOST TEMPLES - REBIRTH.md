# GHOST TEMPLES // REBIRTH

**Rebirth** refers to the rebirth of those that died in accidents of no fault of their own, and were granted another chance to live through the process of rebirth, granted by a Temple Guardian. In standard cases, Temple Guardians choose the most pure souls that were robbed of the proper, long life that they deserved and died too soon in an accident or circumstance they had no control over. This includes accidents like the **2074 Matéiazhu Rail Disaster**, and the **2075 Keustellet Terrorist attacks**, where the Ghosts of *Luna* and *Snow Fox* lost their lives, respectively. 

Upon rebirth, a newly born Ghost is introduced to their new Guardian, that will introduce them to their new life and explain in a light amount of detail what had happened to them in their past one. As all Ghosts struggle with amnesia, where all memories but the Last Light rapidly vanish upon rebirth, this means it will both be easy yet hard for them to adapt to their new lives.

### Drafted Story
*POV: Ghost of Snow Fox

I woke up feeling sore and cold all over, my body felt out of place, but I couldn't lay a finger on what exactly was wrong, the first things I noticed were that the market had been abandoned, filled to the brim with lingering clouds of dust, as if a bomb had gone off; the roof had collapsed near the central aisles, which would explain the cold breeze I was feeling.  \
I slowly tried to move myself upwards, getting more and more accustomed with my shifted body, knowing I'm the same person as I was before, yet also, having no idea where, or rather when, I am. My memories slowly started to seep back in my mind, but as hard as I tried to form a picture of what happened, of who I was, more and more holes began to appear in the picture in my mind, as if it was actively being erased, as if I was forgetting my past right in this very moment. \
Gripping myself on the shelves, I slowly and carefully work my way upright, my legs wobbling as I breathe roughly, coughing often from the dust cloud lingering through the entire market. Slowly looking around, I see right away where I am, the exact same aisle, the exact same place, as where I last saw myself before fainting. But yet again, my vision blurs, colours fade, and as quickly as I begin to remember where I am, I begin to forget.

Groaning softly, I fall back to the floor and move my hand to my forehead, feeling it throb as blood surges through my body as I gradually come to be. A vision repeatedly pulses through my mind, an image of a formally dressed, masked man, black shirt, white robe, a mask completely covering his face, white..\
**"It appears you have awoken, young ghost."** \
A voice booms through the market, echoing off every wall as I turn my head upwards, facing the strange figure that I just pictured in my mind right before me. Millions of questions come to me right away, but none exist my mouth as I only manage to let out a soft gasp, feeling like I'm unable to speak, as if I'm silenced by the strange aura emitted by the figure before me.\
**"Speaking is not advised. It appears you have died."** He says without emotion. Through his mask, I can feel his eyes stare deeply into mine, my body shivering as I now feel completely helpless, completely lost. Feeling tears already begin to build up as every emotion rushes through my mind, from fear to confusion, to anger and sadness, he opens his robe, and reveals a mask. \
**"This will help you speak. Please understand and put it on."** \
Carefully taking the mask from his hand, I study it deeply. A plain, white mask with fox characteristics, especially with its enormous tipped ears. Gulping as I wipe the tears I tried to hide away, I put on the mask, feeling a new stream of energy and warmth instantly stream through my body as I reopen my eyes, gazing upwards at the mysterious figure before me, trying to scramble together the right words. \
*"What's.. going on?"* \
**"I am the Settler of Vászi. You are the Ghost of Snow Fox. Together, we are part of the Temple of Vestia. I understand this is a lot of information to take in at once, for that, I'm sorry"** \
Finishing his words, Vászi carefully bows in an apologetic manner, his robe delicately wrapping around him in a protective manner, almost as if it's a defensive manoeuvre. In response, I crawl upwards, my legs continuing to wobble, now fully aware of the situation I, and my body, are in, while more and more information seeps into my mind from the mask. Catching my breath and readying my words, I prepare myself for the worst of answers. \
*"Vászi, if I may ask, what.. happened?"* \
Without hesitation, the Settler takes a step forward to put a hand on my shoulder, his other hand revealing a copy of an ID card, and flips it around, revealing a small mirror, which in turn reveals my face, mismatching the pictured face on the ID card, as I feel a cold shiver run through my body upon realisation. \
**"On October 4th, 2075, a missile struck the market you find yourself in. At the same time, criminals entered through the North and South sides to plunder and raid the market. Ever since, it has been left vacant. We were not able to rescue your body, but we rescued your soul, and gave you another chance in the body that matches your soul."** \
A chill runs through my spine, and an everlasting moment of silence begins between us. My body had felt odd from the very second I had reawakened, and the glimpse I got of myself in the mirror fully explained why. Moving my hands to my face, I carefully take off the mask, feeling a cold breeze enter my lungs as I take a deep breath, struggling to keep my head high, to keep my emotions beside me for the time being. After what feels like hours, I finally find the strength to stand up, as I stare before me, Vászi's arm extended, feeling his eyes gaze deeply at mine through his mask once more, but feeling a much more inviting, a much more pleasant warmth this time around. Taking his hand, I try to speak, but get cut short, still struggling to speak without wearing my mask, and being interrupted by Vászi. \
**I'm terribly sorry that you had lost your previous life, and I understand your new form is vastly different. I will make a promise: I will guide you, and I will guard you, for I am your Guardian from now on.**
