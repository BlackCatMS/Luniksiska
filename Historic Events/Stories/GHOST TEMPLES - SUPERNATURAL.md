# GHOST TEMPLES // SUPERNATURAL
*Note: This is a draft I came up with and worked out within 10 minutes. It may not be reflected in the actual stories following.*
  
## Settler of Vászi  
**Signature:** Guarding Light  \
Upon casting his signature, Vászi will levitate himself above the ground as various tiny particles begin forming around him. With the chime of a church bell, a light from the heavens will strike down on Vászi, as he then channels this energy to his surroundings, forming an invisible dome in which every being within it will gain extra resistance and energy.  
  
## Ghost of Luna  
**Signature**: Curious Eye  \
Their time in Matéiazhu has given Luna enough time to develop their own signature. From afar, Luna is able to see a person in a distance and immediately learn basic info about them, with more information being collected the longer the gaze stays connected. Upon disconnection from their target, the gained information stays, which may be useful for a future endeavor, or even a threat to the Temple.
  
## Ghost of Snow
**Signature**: Whiteout (Personal Space)  \
While Snow continues to struggle to adapt to her new form, she developed a signature in which she summons a white space, devoid of any other beings but those she's comfortable with, for her to collect her thoughts or regain a moment of peace.
