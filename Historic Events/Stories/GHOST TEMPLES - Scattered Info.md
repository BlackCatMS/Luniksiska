### Temple of Zhuehai
The Temple of Zhuehai is the oldest temple to still be active, having been settled by *Yun Li* way before the other temples, such as Vestia and Álusken, were discovered. This also means that the temple still maintains the **original styles**, which have quickly phased out as new temples sprung up and others were left vacant.

### Temple of Sórskist
The Temple of Sórskist is another unique temple, as it's located deep within the waters away from the *Harbour of Sórskist*. This makes the temple harder to reach and harder to find, but more easily for the various representative ghosts to reach, even despite the pressure from the water.
