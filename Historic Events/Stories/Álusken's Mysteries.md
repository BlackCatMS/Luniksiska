# Álusken's Mysteries

## About Álusken
Unlike Ubunia (Thórirsant, Kérisant, etc.) where cities and areas have become more modern and future-proof than ever seen before, Álusken, located on Vestia (Sharing the continent with Benelux, Denmark) instead progressed backwards, taking a liking into a more medieval atmosphere while keeping the technology advanced to keep its citizens safe.  
  
### Drafted Story
Two people travelling from one outer village to another dwell through the darker forest taking a slight detour to pick berries as a treat. They end up dwelling into pitch blackness, despite it being late in the morning, and realise they're trapped in a dome, blocking them from the outside. The done suddenly starts to spin as the wind picks up, causing the two people to duck to the grond to stay afoot, before the dome suddenly breaks open and disappears. A set of feathers is left behind, a brown talon with beige stripes. Who or what possibly did this?  
  
### Context
Álusken II is very strict on vaccines, only allowing properly tested vaccines to enter his gates. This means Leremkov Vaccines are ruled out, as they aren't properly verified. This too means that people visiting Álusken must verify they have no spreadable variant of the Leremkov Vaccine with them before entering. All in all, Álusken is 99% human.  
  
So what caused this strange dome to appear and haunt the two wanderers? Could it be native fauna to Luniks or an intruder? After they reach the village they report the incident and show them a feather, slowly becoming a folklore mystery.  
  
### Actual
Unclear yet! It's not been decided yet but I want to make magic play a big role in this. How about someone overdosing on Leremkov and becoming a monster instead? (E.g. Harpy, in this case) There's so much room to grow and choose!
