# GHOST TEMPLES // SIGNATURES
All existing ghosts can gather *Spiritual Energy* and use this in various different ways. Below is a list of said **Signatures**, as they are most commonly referred to, and how they are used.

## Settler of Vászi  
**Signature:** Guarding Light  \
Upon casting his signature, Vászi will levitate himself above the ground as various tiny particles begin forming around him. With the chime of a church bell, a light from the heavens will strike down on Vászi, as he then channels this energy to his surroundings, forming an invisible dome in which every being within it will gain extra resistance and energy.  

**Signature (2)**: Blade of Cziskvelén \
Upon casting his signature, Vászi summons the *Blade of Cziskvelén*, which he will lift high up towards the sky, causing him to levitate in similar fashion to **Guarding Light**. Much like that signature, a light from the heavens will strike the blade and cause a church bell to ring, however, this will not form a protective dome, and instead, Vászi will strike the blade forwards and channel the immense energy towards the enemy force.

## Guardian Marten
**Signature**: (Hypothesised) Silent Step \

**Signature (2)**: (Hypothesised) Guarding Light (In apprenticeship)

**Signature (3)**: (Hypothesised) (Unnamed)
A healing pulse. Carried over during his Rebirth, he retained his knowledge within his health science, and uses this to support and heal others if needed.

## Ghost of Luna  
**Signature**: Curious Eye  \
Their time in Matéiazhu has given Luna enough time to develop their own signature. From afar, Luna is able to see a person in a distance and immediately learn basic info about them, with more information being collected the longer the gaze stays connected. Upon disconnection from their target, the gained information stays, which may be useful for a future endeavour, or even a threat to the Temple.

**Signature (2)**:  Shadow Dash \
Channelling the ancient spirit that they carved into the Oni mask, its spirit activates and they begin to focus on the destination they intent to reach. A thick smoke, of which the colour can vary, will seep into the mouthpiece of the mask, which will give Luna the energy and strength they need to take the leap forward. Within the blink of an eye and the snap of a blade, their form vanishes and will reappear in the target destination. Combined with Curious Eye, Luna could use this signature to analyse a potential enemy, and depending on the possible threat, they can use the Shadow Dash to leap forward and confront the target.
  
## Ghost of Snow
**Signature**: Whiteout (Personal Space)  \
While Snow continues to struggle to adapt to her new form, she developed a signature in which she summons a white space, devoid of any other beings but those she's comfortable with, for her to collect her thoughts or regain a moment of peace.

**Signature (2)**: Channelling Astárout \
Utilizing a strength from far beyond the realms of discovered Luniks, Snow has discovered and learned how to channel the powers of the Ancient Spirit of Astárout. This allows her to gain extra strength in dire situations, as described in her **EXPOSURE** entry, where she combined this signature with Whiteout to confront the **Junior Guardian Marten**. As she channels Astárout, her eyes (which are usually a faint, light blue) will glow brightly, as well waving blue fire appearing on her right arm, the tip of her ears and tail. Lastly, the black spots on her right ear (which she reflected in her mask) will also turn a deep, vibrant blue that pulses wildly.
