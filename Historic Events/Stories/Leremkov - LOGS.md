# Leremkov - LOGS
**LOGS** will be a series of logs, written by *Dénis Terczekv* himself, describing the various events or missions he undergoes. This will probably span many years, from the very start of the virus outbreak within Kérisant, to the end of Leremkov himself in Wrocław.  
  
A rough draft of the storyline through drafts will be a series of personal letters to his wife, who he lost to a combination of Leremkov, Influenza, and an unfortunate rail incident, leaving her badly injured and virtually incapable of recovering.  
  
Throughout the storyline, Dénis will write personal letters, but also write professional data analyses from missions, such as *BREACH*.

// Context: This is before Dénis enters the now-abandoned laboratory with his 5 other squad members.

### Drafted log
Hey Emilia, I know it's been a while.

Is it cold down there? I can't help but wonder just where your heart and mind might be now, it's already been several years, yet it still hurts me just as much as it did when you broke the news, contracting both those diseases, and the accident, it's as if the universe had planned something against you. I'll obviously never find out what you were up to in your previous lives, just like I'll never have a clue about mine, but it continued to irk me, it continues to sit wrongly in my stomach. As if the universe *needed* you to die.

I'm rambling too much, I'm sorry. I know I need to keep my head up high, just like you had told me just before you passed. On your deathbed, I promised you that I would find out where this strange Leremkov disease originated from, but despite it being hopeless for years on end, we actually found a trail this time around, Emilia.

Leo and I grouped up together at the office and dug through every bit of information there was available, breaching through classified documents, we put on white and black hats to gather every word there was to find about the virus, but after what felt like a hopeless search and a waste of time, we did find a trail, a trail to the very heart of Kérisant, a hidden laboratory in the outskirts, in the fields of Cévok. 

Not just that, we also found through classified documents that the national security handed over to us that they believe the virus is actually self-named, with the mastermind behind the virus being Vitaly Leremkov. We dug further and further, finding that he studied biology and gene-editing, which all lined up with the strange disease you caught after you took your shot for Influenza, which then only worsened it instead of improving it. But those details aside, we believe that Leremkov is resided within those labs, within Cévok, so, so close to us. 

We set up a plan, Emilia, we're going to infiltrate and breach, and we'll make everyone present pay for the damage they did to not just you, but to every resident of Kérisant, and wherever the virus spread further. I know it's a big leap, I know that it frightens me too, because I don't know what I will find within those labs, or if I might learn about a cure too late, but I promise one thing, my love, I will make sure that nobody else will need to suffer the way you did anymore.

I love you, rest easy.

// Context: After BREACH, Dénis found a laptop containing a series of data and logs that continued their initial trail that they found, leading them to Poland.

### Drafted Log
Hey Emilia, I have a lot of tell.

Just like I said a few days ago, we breached the laboratory, but found it was abandoned shortly beforehand. I already gave you the details of everything we found, but the one thing that stood out was that laptop that I stumbled upon by pure accident, and how I put every single file I could find on my USB Drive and that Leo and I would analyse it when we were all done and back at the office.

Well, it's been a few days ever since, and our trail continued. We had just missed out on confronting Leremkov himself by a few days, because by pure surprise it turned out that he had in fact moved back to Poland, where he originally came from. It seems like a long shot, travelling all the way to Earth in hopes that we can find a similar laboratory in the heart of a blooming city. It all looks grim, but both Leo and I were hopeful to find out where exactly he was hiding.

But more interestingly, I discovered that a lot of the symptoms you were showing on your deathbed connected more to Leremkov than to Influenza. You mentioned your sense of smell having rapidly changed, that you picked up scents you never could before, and that it all overstimulated you. It began making sense. The strange disease that spread throughout the country was all similar to what you had, but whereas others gained more noticeable animal traits, it was just your sense of smell that had changed, and your body suppressed the rest, as much as it could, anyway. It's been a lot of years since, but I'm glad that after this long, we did finally find an answer as to why you were in so much pain, yet the more does it hurt me to find a cure for all of this too late. 

Emilia, I will make my way to Earth, but I will bring you along with me. Even if I need to personally take matters in my own hands and take his life by force, I will do so. I will never forgive this man for the damage he has done to you, to everyone else. Leo and I both agreed that we would make this our life goal, that we would track down Leremkov and put an end to this once and for all. Even though the irreversible damage has been dealt, and many others have lost family or friends, just like I had lost you, I will make sure that nobody else will need to suffer like you have.

I love you, rest easy.
