# Temporary drafts 
This file solely exists to prevent merge conflicts from happening in [[Story Drafts]], or any of the applicable stories that the drafts take place in. Additionally, this file is used as a draft board for topics or parts I want to develop later on in the story, and may give a tease as to what's to come next.

## Leremkov - PENDULUM
Self insert into pendulum - Receive aid and care through Vienna & Olen.

## Ghost Temples - Repurposing of Masks
As more characters came into play with Ghost Temples, the necessity of masks came down as a result. So far, only **Luna** and **Snow** have received a mask for a specific reason, but every character since has not been given a mask that represented them as a person. 

Because of this, I believe it's fine to keep the masks as they are, but repurpose them into a *vanity project* for the characters themselves. **Luna** preferred to keep their identity hidden from the masses with fears of being spotted, and for **Snow**, it's a means to pursue her dreams of becoming a versatile artist from before she had died. 

For **Temple Guardians**, the masks will remain the same, and will also remain a tradition. The *plain white mask*, which has made an appearance plenty of times, will remain as tradition for **Rebirths**, and Marten will continue to wear his unique *half-mask* that only covers his face below his eyes. With this, I believe that I can lessen the pressure on coming up with specific and forced masks and character details that I don't believe really fit the characters, and might steer the project into a direction that's far too niche and not aligned with what I truly aim for.

## Reaching Lúniks - Descriptions for Observatories
More thorough descriptions regarding various launchpads/control centres/research centres. Including:
### Lappland Observatory
Based in **Northern Finland**, the **Lappland Observatory** manages and researches the planet of **Lúniks** from **Earth**. To reduce the loads on **Geneva**, it took over control of the Hubble space telescope and has since also kept its eyes on the various satellites and landers that found themselves in orbit or on Lúniks itself.
### Control Lyon (Launchpad Lyon)
**Control Lyon**, up until 2033, was the primary launchpad for launching all sorts of satellites and ships towards Lúniks, or to receive incoming ships. From 2033 onwards, it served home to the first **ELE Corridor** connection, creating a commercial means of transport between Lyon and Nóve Réjkjavik. 
### Control Geneva
### Control Shánzhe (Launchpad Shánzhe)


## Reaching Lúniks / TRAVEL RISK - Merger with Cisila
Directly inspired by Evie's [Cisila Siveta](https://github.com/eviedense/CI.SI) storyline. More specific information is available in the hyperlinked repository. \
Currently being worked out into [[Lúniks Timeline]].

### Reaching Lúniks (CI.SI: Brain drain, 1995-2035)
Both **Reaching Lúniks** and **Travel Risk** will take inspiration from the aforementioned story, and will attempt to be placed in one and the same universe. **Cisila's Story** takes place in the *United States*, a country on Earth that has never been mentioned before in any of the existing stories (**As of May 2024**). The reason for this is because of the immense security risks that followed soon after **PALMER-EDEN** was founded, and spread throughout the country to provide almost every service imaginable. This led to not only economic concerns, but also privacy and safety concerns, and with its tight grip on every market possible increasing, a number of institutes and companies fled the US to instead base themselves in Canada or Europe, similarly to how companies and organisations fled to **Rhódisz** after the **Collapse of United Máneá**. One of these organisations is **NASA**, who will depart the US around the year 1995, a few years after the successful launch of the *Hubble Telescope*. Its researchers follow and join the **ESA** in Geneva and the **Lappland Observatory** in Lappland, using their experiences and knowledge to snowball the eventual launch of **One** and kickstarting settlement of Lúniks.

While this all plays out, the US instead experiences a brain drain and begins to spiral into a state of despair, with the security of the nation beginning to become unstable and boiling up to what is believed to be an "internal cold war". Before long, PALMER-EDEN begins experiments on humans, with organs that its CEO considers part of "**Ultima**", a series of experimental organs that give humans that possess them various superpowers, one of them being **Cisila**. With this internal risk and with nationwide uncertainty, the US instead locks down its borders and refuses to reopen them, immediately causing the **European Union** and **Canada** to become the next superpower nations while the US instead crumbles down.

### Travel Risk (INTERIM: PALMER-EDEN (US) fallout)
**INTERIM**, in its current state, takes place in 2087, and is a story about the aftermath of a major incident in one of **PALMER-EDEN**'s underground cities. While not being directly linked to **Travel Risk**, it can still pose as an example of what *not* to do when in uncertainty, and can be directly used as an example of what will happen when **Máneá** and **Zakh'háfo** truly spiral out of control and become a dictatorship, too. 

## TRAVEL RISK - Nova Character 
Nova will be recruited into an Agency after having undergone military training and service in Eastern Kérisant, partaking in the **Mharáni unrest**, and is originally from **Strava Mikkë**.
### Drafted Story - REFRESH
A story encompassing Nova's first mission after reaching Zakh'háfo, and her first contact with The Agency and Vátnelári. In this mission, she receives the simple task of deceiving a dealer that ran away from Vátnelári, and is hiding in various bars throughout the days to stay out of sight, and to prevent getting himself killed. Nova enters the bar and tries to get in touch with him, offering a more personal conversation while not ticking him off, and gets in contact with the bartender as well in order to spike his drink with a drug that should be lethal for him during the night. Uses quote **"You're adorable. It's a shame I have to kill you."** On the way out after successfully drugging and thus killing this dealer, she stumbles upon Nils in the exit, and then engage in a small talk.
