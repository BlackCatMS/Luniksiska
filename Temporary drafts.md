# Temporary drafts 
This file solely exists to prevent merge conflicts from happening in [[Story Drafts]], or any of the applicable stories that the drafts take place in. Additionally, this file is used as a draft board for topics or parts I want to develop later on in the story, and may give a tease as to what's to come next.

## Leremkov - PENDULUM
Self insert into pendulum - Receive aid and care through Vienna & Olen.

## Ghost Temples - Repurposing of Masks
As more characters came into play with Ghost Temples, the necessity of masks came down as a result. So far, only **Luna** and **Snow** have received a mask for a specific reason, but every character since has not been given a mask that represented them as a person. 

Because of this, I believe it's fine to keep the masks as they are, but repurpose them into a *vanity project* for the characters themselves. **Luna** preferred to keep their identity hidden from the masses with fears of being spotted, and for **Snow**, it's a means to pursue her dreams of becoming a versatile artist from before she had died. 

For **Temple Guardians**, the masks will remain the same, and will also remain a tradition. The *plain white mask*, which has made an appearance plenty of times, will remain as tradition for **Rebirths**, and Marten will continue to wear his unique *half-mask* that only covers his face below his eyes. With this, I believe that I can lessen the pressure on coming up with specific and forced masks and character details that I don't believe really fit the characters, and might steer the project into a direction that's far too niche and not aligned with what I truly aim for.

## Ghost Temples - GLIMMER // Marten
### Drafted
In his sleep, Marten finds himself back in his previous life, meeting with his friends at the University of Lasz once more. They catch up with each other, and his friends mention that they still can't believe he actually managed to heal and recover from his heart cancer. This arises one of the many questions to follow in his mind, as the more he wonders what is going on, the more the details of the world around him disappear, instead being exchanged for plain, white and featureless structures. Instead of a dream, it gradually turns into a nightmare for Marten, but after suddenly waking up, he instead finds himself in the same bed as always, encapsulated by a white dome. Turning to his left, he sees Snow still fast asleep, but somehow having sensed that he was in distress, she snapped him out of the dream and activated her Whiteout, in hopes to help his nightmares.



## TRAVEL RISK - Nova Character 
Nova will be recruited into an Agency after having undergone military training and service in Eastern Kérisant, partaking in the **Mharáni unrest**, and is originally from **Strava Mikkë**.
