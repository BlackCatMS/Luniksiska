# Temporary drafts 
This file solely exists to prevent merge conflicts from happening in [[Historic Events/Stories/Story Drafts]], or any of the applicable stories that the drafts take place in. Additionally, this file is used as a draft board for topics or parts I want to develop later on in the story, and may give a tease as to what's to come next.

## Leremkov - PENDULUM
Self insert into pendulum - Receive aid and care through Vienna & Olen.

## Reaching Lúniks- Once We Reach Lúniks
This story is as good as done, but needs to receive a proper proofread and touchups accordingly, which will improve the flow drastically. Currently, it's lacking a lot.

## Reaching Lúniks - Emails
Email (2005) from Masego to Lesenen regarding lander ELL-6 (Vaon Lander) losing connection after getting destroyed. This lander was intended to analyse the Vaon auroras in thorough detail from the ground upwards. Supposedly, a strange force destroyed ELL-6, and will need proper analysis when Vestia begins allocation and settlement.

Email (2006) from Akájune to Masego, Lesenen regarding his concerns about developing **Five**, and its necessity. The ESA proposed to iterate and develop **Five**, based off the functions for **Three** and **Four**, the last of which is due to depart a week from writing. \
Akájune describes that it would be the smartest to have **Two** return to Earth and restock, especially with reports that it's still in perfect shape and would have enough fuel to survive a Loop jump and travel to France. \
A return email from Lesenen should include the ESA's response and plan for having **Two** return to Earth as a handshake trade while **Four** lands with new supplies and people.

Email (2009) regarding the completed allocation of Ubunia and commencement of allocation of Vestia. Ships **Two** through **Four** carry the necessities, while lander ELL-9 begins its research in Deónia.

## TRAVEL RISK - Mika's Backstory
What bought Mika to Dáritke? How come he has so much neurotech installed in his body? Mika's backstory should make this clear.

## TRAVEL RISK - Nova Character 
**Nova** (Katherina): A cold-blooded sniper and marksman expert that has up to 30 untraced kills to her name. Most notable for landing a clean shot from 4000 metres away, without using a scope. The signs point to her having neurotech in her left eye, which may be the reason she's as precise as she is. She is also known as Mono Nova for her quiet and untraced shots. She expertises in every sort of calibre, in every climate, and against every target. Once she has you in her sights, godspeed.

Nova will be recruited into an Agency after having undergone military training and service in Eastern Kérisant, partaking in the **Mharáni unrest**, and is originally from **Strava Mikkëi**.

### Drafted Story - Where Ellitróómi Fails // Whiteout
Story encompassing Nova's last "freelance" mission in Northern Ellitróómi, near the Íszkéde border. She is ordered to step in-between a convicted mass murderer. She hides and camouflages herself in the Eastern Ellitróómi mountains, dressed and decorated in white clothing and snow, wielding one of the strongest rifles she expertises in. With the murderer supposedly living in a small mountain village, she could land a shot from over 5km away, and does so at ease.
### Drafted Story - REFRESH
Story encompassing Nova's first mission after reaching Zakh'háfo, and her first contact with The Agency and Vátnelári. In this mission, she receives the simple task of deceiving a dealer that ran away from Vátnelári, and is hiding in various bars throughout the days to stay out of sight, and to prevent getting himself killed. Nova enters the bar and tries to get in touch with him, offering a more personal conversation while not ticking him off, and gets in contact with the bartender as well in order to spike his drink with a drug that should be lethal for him during the night. Uses quote **"You're adorable. It's a shame I have to kill you."** On the way out after successfully drugging and thus killing this dealer, she stumbles upon Nils in the exit, and then engage in a small talk.
