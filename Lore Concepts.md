# Lore Concepts
These ideas are currently under construction and are noted down separately as they can change the whole idea of Luniks, or even humanity's understanding of the universe as a whole. A few drafted ideas like these are worked out below.

## Magic
*For PENDULUM, see [[Story Drafts]]*
Much like the word suggests, the introduction of magic into the world of Luniks would make things take on a completely different concept. The story of [[Vitaly Leremkov, 2039-2098]] would gain a differently concept, ruling out vaccines and becoming centered around magic instead.

As much complication as it brings, it would also become a trump card for anything currently unexplainable. A complete terraformation of a piece of land would be considered impossible in today's knowledge and technology, but simply saying it's because of the understanding of magic at that moment would reduce the need for complex lore as well.

New flora and fauna would easily bloom on Luniks, as this planet is still completely new and untouched, and with global unions making sure the newly colonised planet wouldn't end up as another Earth, this would then stay in place, keeping the balance between an influx of humanity and remained places and areas for existing fauna, as well as fauna brought over from earth. 


## Time Exploitation
Luniks was officially colonised early 2005, and with numerous countries and cities being built ever since, this would mean there would be an insane demand for produciton materials. This could tie hand in hand with magic, but exploiting time so that the time to produce materials would be shortened all the way down to a matter of seconds would make it "realistic" to make Luniks bloom as quick as it did.
