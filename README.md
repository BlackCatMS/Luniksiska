# Luniks | 
Luniksan is a spoken language which is mostly spoken in the Thórirsant and Kérisant area of the planet Luniks. Already too much info? This repository, or rather note collection, collects all that had happened on this planet, and tries to put it into a somewhat comprehensible set of words, so everyone else can dive deep into the unknown together with me.[^1]

# Meet the planet guarded by the Ring |
Guarded by Alkéisa's Ring, this Ring creates an artificial layer and magnetic field surrounding the planet similarly to that of Earth, while visually similar to Neptune's ring. Developed by physicist and technician Matéus Alkéisa, it was deployed and activated in 2087, guarding and protecting the ever blooming planet ever since.

# Distinct. United. |
Spanning four continents and many more countries and territories, Luniks is home to a diverse and unique set of inhabitants. While mostly similar to Earth from migration, this planet still supports and is home to unique flora and fauna never seen before. Cultural differences emerged between countries and continents but one thing remains certain forever. Everyone shares this planet. Everyone is united.

# Gaze into infinity |
Surrounded by a vast family of similar planets in its solar system, the Luniks project and journey doesn't end just there. A trip from Earth was just the beginning, a glimpse of the intergalactic future within reach. Luniks has become a hub for interstellar travel within a century, ever increasing and vastly growing for millions of people, a precedent to the future of humanity.
