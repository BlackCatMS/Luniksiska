# Luniks | 
Despite English still being the lingua franca, Luniksan is a language that is becoming increasingly dominant in nations on Ubunia and Vestia, with the exception of Ellitróómi and Mharáni. Already overwhelmed by info? This repository, or rather note collection, gathers all events that have happened on this planet, and all stories that unfolded when the first spaceship landed in 2005. I've done my best to put it down in a comprehensible set of words, so that everyone else can dive deep into the unknown together with me.[^1]

# Meet the planet guarded by the Ring |
Guarded by Alkéisa's Ring, an artificial layer of protection and a magnetic field surround the planet just like Earth does naturally, while visually looking like Neptune's ring. Developed by physicist and technician Matéus Alkéisa, it was deployed and activated in 2037, guarding and protecting the ever blooming planet since.

# Distinct. United. |
Spanning four continents and many more nations and territories, Luniks is home to a diverse and unique set of inhabitants. While mostly similar to Earth from migration, this planet still supports and is home to unique flora and fauna never seen before. Cultural differences emerged between nations and continents but one thing remains certain forever. Everyone shares this planet. Everyone is united.

# Mysteries Unfolded |
With the discovery of a new planet, so comes the discovery of new mysteries. New lifeforms and technologies accelerated by an ever-burning desire to grow, creatures never before seen, flowers never before bloomed. Will humanity successfully find peace with these new challenges, or will they fall right after taking their next step?

# Gaze into infinity |
Surrounded by a vast family of similar planets in its galaxy, the journey doesn't end just there. A trip from Earth to Luniks was just the beginning, a glimpse of the intergalactic future within reach. Within a century, Luniks is soon to become an interstellar hub, ever increasing and vastly growing for millions of people, a precedent to the future of humanity.
