# Liétivus Pact, 2168 Mar 30
### Pact status: ACCEPTED
The Liétivus Pact is a pact between Ellitroomi and Thórirsant in which is agreed no further action will be taken to stabilise the existing conflict taking place in Kósfrii, which has been at a rough war with itself since 2166, leading to a complete collapse of the city and surrounding region. \
Proposed by Sander Liétivus, on April 19th 2167, it has taken nearly a full year to gain support and pass the pact between the two nations, to which Kérisant has also agreed and signed on in September 2167. 

> "I've realised how deeply Kósfrii has sunk to the ground. After a year of non-stop support to ease and cease the riots and war, none of our efforts have improved the situation in the slightest. To me, the only option for us as a nation, is to let Kósfrii fall. All evacuation attempts we've made were succesful, the city has been drained and emptied of civillians, and we are positive that the flow of weapons will soon end, resulting in the end of this horrible conflict"
- Sander Liétivus, 2167

This pact oughts the following:
- Neither Thórirsant nor Ellitroomi (Kérisant per November 2167) shall assist or oppose any incidents occuring within the Kósfrii city region. 
- Regions surrounding Kósfrii, most notably Kirwijets and Sléta, shall receive supplies to aid the wounded that have been rescued from the Kósfrii centre.

#### This pact has been accepted and signed on Mar 30 2168
