# Leremkov - LOGS
**LOGS** will be a series of logs, written by *Dénis Terczekv* himself, describing the various events or missions he undergoes. This will probably span many years, from the very start of the virus outbreak within Kérisant, to the end of Leremkov himself in Wrocław.  
  
A rough draft of the storyline through drafts will be a series of personal letters to his wife, who he lost to a combination of Leremkov, Influenza, and an unfortunate rail incident, leaving her badly injured and virtually incapable of recovering.  
  
Throughout the storyline, Dénis will write personal letters, but also write professional data analyses from missions, such as *BREACH*.

// Context: Emilia, who caught Influenza and took an infected vaccine in hopes that it would help cure her from said disease, now contracts Leremkov on top of it, causing her to be bed-ridden for the rest of her lifetime. This takes place a week after her death and burial.

### Drafted Log
Hey, Emilia, this isn't easy for me to write, especially now that you can't reply to me anymore.

It's been a week already since we lowered you down there into the ground, in your beautifully decorated coffin that your kindergarten class had helped you paint. I hope wherever you might be now, that you're long gone from the horrible amount of suffering you endured, that you can live on in pure peace and without pain. 

It's still tough to write this, Emilia, the tears are already rolling down my cheeks as I write this, I feel like I've hit a dead end, that I don't know where to go next, but just like you had a wish to be buried next you your parents in the garden of Égézëha, you wished for me to live onwards and carefree, and that you never wanted anyone else to suffer the way you did before your last breath.

That brings me to what I wanted to let you know, Emilia. I'd brought you a bouquet of flowers like I promised I would every Friday after your death, before I was tapped on the shoulder by a man I didn't know. He introduced himself to me as Leo Hartleigh, saying that he too felt sorry for the loss of your beautiful life. But not just that, he offered me a job, and not just any job. He handed me a postcard with an address, which he claimed belonged to "A private research organisation". 

In short, I will be working in Weshalt, starting in August, where I will join Leo and a few others in tracking down the source of this "Leremkov disease" that costed you your life. Everyone, including me, believed that it *had* to be a hand-made virus, because there was no such thing as a natural virus that would cause the DNA-alterations and side-effects that you had experienced, much like any other person that had undergone the same. 

Emilia, you had one wish, which was that you never wanted anyone else to suffer the same way you did anymore. With this job, I will help you achieve that dream, and make sure nobody needs to go through the same hell that you have gone through.

I love you, Emilia, rest easy.

Hey Emilia, I know it's been a while.

Is it cold down there? I can't help but wonder just where your heart and mind might be now, it's already been several years, yet it still hurts me just as much as it did when you broke the news, contracting both those diseases, and the accident, it's as if the universe had planned something against you. I'll obviously never find out what you were up to in your previous lives, just like I'll never have a clue about mine, but it continued to irk me, it continues to sit wrongly in my stomach. As if the universe *needed* you to die.

I'm rambling too much, I'm sorry. I know I need to keep my head up high, just like you had told me just before you passed. On your deathbed, I promised you that I would find out where this strange Leremkov disease originated from, but despite it being hopeless for years on end, we actually found a trail this time around, Emilia.

Leo and I grouped up together at the office and dug through every bit of information there was available, breaching through classified documents, we put on white and black hats to gather every word there was to find about the virus, but after what felt like a hopeless search and a waste of time, we did find a trail, a trail to the very heart of Kérisant, a hidden laboratory in the outskirts, in the fields of Cévok. 

Not just that, we also found through classified documents that the national security handed over to us that they believe the virus is actually self-named, with the mastermind behind the virus being Vitaly Leremkov. We dug further and further, finding that he studied biology and gene-editing, which all lined up with the strange disease you caught after you took your shot for Influenza, which then only worsened it instead of improving it. But those details aside, we believe that Leremkov is resided within those labs, within Cévok, so, so close to us. 

We set up a plan, Emilia, we're going to infiltrate and breach, and we'll make everyone present pay for the damage they did to not just you, but to every resident of Kérisant, and wherever the virus spread further. I know it's a big leap, I know that it frightens me too, because I don't know what I will find within those labs, or if I might learn about a cure too late, but I promise one thing, my love, I will make sure that nobody else will need to suffer the way you did anymore.

I love you, rest easy.

// Context: After BREACH, Dénis found a laptop containing a series of data and logs that continued their initial trail that they found, leading them to Poland.

### Drafted Log
Hey Emilia, I have a lot of tell.

Just like I said a few days ago, we breached the laboratory, but found it was abandoned shortly beforehand. I already gave you the details of everything we found, but the one thing that stood out was that laptop that I stumbled upon by pure accident, and how I put every single file I could find on my USB Drive and that Leo and I would analyse it when we were all done and back at the office.

Well, it's been a few days ever since, and our trail continued. We had just missed out on confronting Leremkov himself by a few days, because by pure surprise it turned out that he had in fact moved back to Poland, where he originally came from. It seems like a long shot, travelling all the way to Earth in hopes that we can find a similar laboratory in the heart of a blooming city. It all looks grim, but both Leo and I were hopeful to find out where exactly he was hiding.

But more interestingly, I discovered that a lot of the symptoms you were showing on your deathbed connected more to Leremkov than to Influenza. You mentioned your sense of smell having rapidly changed, that you picked up scents you never could before, and that it all overstimulated you. It began making sense. The strange disease that spread throughout the country was all similar to what you had, but whereas others gained more noticeable animal traits, it was just your sense of smell that had changed, and your body suppressed the rest, as much as it could, anyway. It's been a lot of years since, but I'm glad that after this long, we did finally find an answer as to why you were in so much pain, yet the more does it hurt me to find a cure for all of this too late. 

Emilia, I will make my way to Earth, but I will bring you along with me. Even if I need to personally take matters in my own hands and take his life by force, I will do so. I will never forgive this man for the damage he has done to you, to everyone else. Leo and I both agreed that we would make this our life goal, that we would track down Leremkov and put an end to this once and for all. Even though the irreversible damage has been dealt, and many others have lost family or friends, just like I had lost you, I will make sure that nobody else will need to suffer like you have.

I love you, rest easy.

// Context: Soon after Dénis lands and takes temporary residence in Poland in the hunt for Leremkov, ultimately leading towards a dead end.

### Drafted Log
Hey Emilia, remind me to travel back to Kérisant and never again travel between planets. It's a stomach-turning experience, and I really have no idea how they made this commercial.  
  
But with that said, you can assume that I made my way to Earth, to Poland now. Leo, Emil, and myself were granted a temporary home in the outskirts of Toruń, a city I had never heard of before but seemingly holds a vast amount of history. It's going to be a long hunt, Poland might not be as big as Kérisant itself, but it would be trying to find a needle in a haystack, we need to track down a basement laboratory in an area as big as the Biszhúvek and Gálinian provinces combined. 

I've already had moments where I felt like it was worthless in the end, but every time that thought crosses my mind, I make sure to have the same picture of you I bring everywhere with me by my side, as a reminder that it's worth it in the end. You wouldn't want me to quit right now either, not now that I, and my team, caught this trail. We're closer than ever in bringing this to and end, and I'll make sure that it'll be worth it, no matter how tough or difficult things may get. I won't allow others to face the same fate as you.
