# Leremkov Trials
Having completely spiralled out of control, much like the Leremkov virus itself, the development of this story is now in a separate entry altogether.

## Leremkov Trials
A broad definition and explanation of the Leremkov Trials is that *Dr. Vitaly Leremkov* altered human DNA over the span of 30 years, altering the DNA of a significant amount of humanity over this time, giving them animalistic traits, such as the sense of smell of a dog or antlers like a deer. Because "Leremkov Vaccines" quickly became a mouthful early on when often referring to people who were affected by them, it has become standard to refer to affected people as "People affected by Leremkov", or simply by calling the virus "Leremkov".

Much like Leremkov, stories that grow big enough and no longer end up fitting as drafts will end up in their own document. 

The Leremkov Trials as a whole is a big project. Below is a draft image of the content the Leremkov Trials had to mention.

## Vitaly Leremkov 
*Vitaly's complete story is available at [[Vitaly Leremkov, 2039-2095]].* \
Vitaly Leremkov, born in Sochi but having lived in Poznań for most of his life, was a biologist who specialised in genetics and DNA, using his knowledge for evil, rather than good, later on in his life, as he devoted the remaining years altering humanity's DNA in order to incorporate animal DNA and create a perfect blend, claiming he "desired a destiny like Þórirson".

## David & Stacy
The drafted story for David & Stacy has been extracted to [[PENDULUM]], as this will most likely be the story they will be included in.

## Vienna & Olen
**Vienna & Olen**, as well as their descriptions, roles, and the planned story regarding them, have also been extracted to [[PENDULUM]]. As of *January 2024*, the two stories will most likely be combined into one under the story of **LEREMKOV - PENDULUM**, in order to retain a good oversight over the story as a whole.

## BREACH
*BREACH* is an in-depth look at how **Dénis Terczekv** infiltrated Leremkov's secret *Genetic Labs*, where he produced the vaccine that cause the irreversible damage to humanity's genes and DNA. As a start, various snippets will be developed, after which they will gradually be tied together and form a cohesive story. 

This story is available at [[BREACH]], and additionally, Dénis's **LOGS** that precede and succeed the events in **BREACH** are available at [[LOGS]]

## Other scattered info
Once infected by Leremkov, it will take a few hours before the effects really become noticeable. During these hours, the virus becomes "hyperactive", as your skin might start irritating, your nose might become runny or you'll have intense coughing fits.  \
These coughing fits are vital in spreading the virus, and this is something Leremkov himself was keen on implementing when first creating this virus. The virus will float in the air or stick to surfaces as you cough or sneeze, and easily infect the next person to touch the now-infected item. This way, cities like Cévok and eventually Poznań would succumb to the immense speed the virus spread at.
