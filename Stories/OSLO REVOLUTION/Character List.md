# OSLO REVOLUTION // CHARACTERS
This Character List belongs to [[OSLO REVOLUTION]].

## Lars Persson, Sergus Persson (Awaiting inclusion)
Both have led the revolution that took place in Oslo, Norway. However, since the direction and course of the Luniks project has been changed so often and so much, the Oslo revolution no longer fits within the timeline of Luniks. This means both people will either disappear within the story, or stay and become attached to a different story.    
## Ricky Reiut (Awaiting inclusion)
Described above, Reiut is also part of the Oslo revolution, or at least part of the organisation that led up to the revolution. The same applies to Reiut; The Oslo revolution no longer fits in line with Luniks, which means the character will be repurposed or removed.  
## Seventh Léjtuse (Awaiting inclusion)
The Seventh Léjtuse is intended to be an insurgent army also involved in the Oslo revolution, but as described with Persson and Reiut above, this is put back to the concept board.
