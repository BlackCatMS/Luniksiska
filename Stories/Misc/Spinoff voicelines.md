| Appointed as Assistant      | There's an enormous workload you have, Doctor. I'll help you out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Talk 1                      | I thought the **ARC** was big, but even Rhodes Island itself dwarfs its size. There's a lot of questions I want answered, yet so little time to ask them..                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Talk 2                      | Are you in the need for coffee, Doctor? I brought a special brew from back home. Originally *Emyrian*, it's the perfect blend between slightly on the darker side, but not being too bitter on the tongue. Of course, I can also make you a standard black coffee..                                                                                                               |
| Talk 3                      | If I'd go back to *Carbine*? In a heartbeat. But that option is no longer there. Instead of dwelling on it, I will use all my strength to instead aid you, Doctor.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Talk 4                      | Doctor, I noticed a trend in the operators in Rhodes Island.. are they all *Leremkovi*? No? Interesting.. I'll ask *Olivia* about this sometime.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Talk after Promotion 1      | *Olivia* forwarded be some work from Rhine Lab, and it actually made me see some similarities between them and *Carbine*. Maybe even all these lightyears away from each other, things aren't too different.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Talk after Promotion 2      | You hide behind the mask, but I can see even in your eyes what you long to ask me. I will forever long to return to *Lúniks*, but I've adapted to life on *Terra* properly, too. The knowledge I have acquired in my past years are beneficial to the research taking place in Rhodes Island and Rhine Lab. It's a difficult path, but it's one I will walk without looking back. |
| Talk after Trust Increase 1 | You make me wonder, Doctor, is there something you're hiding behind your back? Whether it's Rhodes Island's mission, its relations with the other countries, or the underlying imminence of Catastrophies, I feel like there's something rooted even deeper than that.                                                                                                            |
| Talk after Trust Increase 2 | I wish I'd gotten the opportunity to meet *Kristen*. I recognise a portion of myself in the stories about her that I've been told. A longing dream to reach into space, and see the beauty that lies behind. There's questions that remain unanswered, like what lies behind the *Skypod*, but I'll save you my knowledge. Unless you're into nightmares?                         |
| Talk after Trust Increase 3 | I feel like I've gotten more adjusted to being on land again. It's not only *Kal'tsit* that's helped me adjust, but *Olivia*, *Saria*, and *Muelsyse* have come in touch with me more frequently as well. Even if it's a tough pill to swallow, Rhode Island is starting to become my home, now.                                                                                  |
| Idle                        | ..You're sleeping? I'll handle this pile of papers, Doctor. You can take a deserved break.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Onboard                     | I'm Maria Limáida, aerospace and aeronautical researcher from *Carbine Industries*. I look forward to working together with you, Doctor.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Watching Battle Record      | It's a necessary evil. I understand.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Promotion 1                 | Promotion? I'm glad to hear my work is effective, that means I'm adapting properly to the workflow within Rhodes Island. I'll use this as a new foundation for myself to improve on, for the benefit of everyone else.                                                                                                                                                            |
| Promotion 2                 | Even if the period has been short, the skills attained have been grand. Our ideals match, Doctor, and I will fight alongside you to reach our common goal together. If a similar issue would make an appearance on *Lúniks*, I'm sure the roles would be reversed.                                                                                                                |
| Added to Squad              | I will aid where necessary.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Appointed as Squad Leader   | I've stood here before.

| Talk after Promotion 1      | My left eye? It's an iridescent, luminescent pink, and it allows me to illude whoever I look at. The wings in the corners of your eyes, brushing your cheeks and surely beginning to constrict your breathing? Congratulations, you've fallen for an illusion.                                                           |
| Talk after Promotion 2      | My right eye? It's plain white, but much more powerful than you'd imagine. Your robe and hood reveal a long, dark history. I know about *Babel*, I know about *Theresa*, and I see the disruption she's left behind. Doctor, history is a powerful means of advancing forward. Don't repeat the mistakes that haunt you. |
| Talk after Trust Increase 1 | I see similarities between my beliefs, and those of yours. Is the *Perceiver* the same, or similar to the *Observers*? In the end, the answer may take another century to find, but it's a question to keep in mind along the *Voyage*.                                                                                  |
| Talk after Trust Increase 2 | Body horror? I wouldn't consider it that, but you're not the first to call it such. After all, it's simply an illusion.

| Talk after Trust Increase 3 | It bothers me. Opening my eyes allows me to see the history of everything. I've seen every place Rhodes Island has gone to, and thus the rise and fall of Babel, even *Kal'tsit* has allowed me to see her past. But yours? I simply cannot. Can you do it verbally?                                                     |

| Talk 1                      | I'm not Siracusan, but I can understand your confusion. After all, the average person wouldn't see the difference between a Siracusan Lupo and myself either.                                           |
| Talk 2                      | The scars on my hands are not the result of Oripathy, but it could be considered as something similar. It grows and crystallises upon use, and doesn't shrink away after. Maybe it *is* Oripathy?       |
| Talk 3                      | If I'm quiet, I'm probably lost in thought. Or I'm tracing the lines on my arm. Think nothing of it.                                                                                                    |
| Talk after Promotion 1      | The crystals on my arm don't hurt, unless pressure is put onto them. It doesn't bleed, but neither does it regress.                                                                                     |
| Talk after Promotion 2      | I've killed plenty of people in my past, often without an underlying reason. But you, Doctor, have given me enough reason to continue to fight.                                                         |
| Talk after Trust Increase 1 | If anything, creating fire at will can be as beneficial as it is bothersome. I won't need to think about feeling cold, but it does come with the risk of burning the landship to the ground.            |
| Talk after Trust Increase 2 | Is *Windbreak* here too? *I miei occhi non mentono*, (My eyes don't lie), I can recognise her from even the furthest of distances. I'll catch up with her once I'm on break.                            |

| Talk 1                      | I'm surprised I feel at home on Rhodes Island. Is it because of the similarities with SOLARdawn? Maybe not in terms of ethics, but then again, my *spear* did bleed for the both of them..                                                                          |
| Talk 2                      | I still think I see familiar faces even on Rhodes Island, but every time I think I recognise someone, they're already long gone.                                                                                                                                    |

| Talk after Promotion 1      | The discolouration on my hand is a side effect from using the *spear* and channelling my flames through it, but so far, it's not something that harms me. In fact, I think it looks relatively cool, don't you agree?                                               |
| Talk after Promotion 2      | My tally grows, and it will forever grow so long I choose to raise and thrust my *spear* forward. Turning back? It's too late for that, Doctor.                                                                                                                     |
| Talk after Trust Increase 1 | You can ask about my past all you want, but I simply remember none of it. Coming to think of it, isn't that similar to what you're experiencing, Doctor?                                                                                                            |
| Talk after Trust Increase 2 | Doctor, do you wonder what happened before you lost your memories? I wonder about mine too, and I constantly get told about the person who I was before I was given the *Flame Heart*. But she's a vastly different person from myself, are they telling the truth? |
| Talk after Trust Increase 3 | Maybe if we put our heads together, we can both figure out each other's pasts. That way, maybe we can learn whether we've advanced or regressed as a person. And that way, we can improve ourselves even further. Say, Doctor, up for a long talk together?         |
