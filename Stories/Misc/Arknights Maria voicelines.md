| Appointed as Assistant      | There's an enormous workload you have, Doctor. I'll help you out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Talk 1                      | I thought the **ARC** was big, but even Rhodes Island itself dwarfs its size. There's a lot of questions I want answered, yet so little time to ask them..                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Talk 2                      | Are you in the need for coffee, Doctor? I brought a special brew from back home. Originally *Emyrian*, it's the perfect blend between slightly on the darker side, but not being too bitter on the tongue. Of course, I can also make you a standard black coffee..                                                                                                               |
| Talk 3                      | If I'd go back to *Carbine*? In a heartbeat. But that option is no longer there. Instead of dwelling on it, I will use all my strength to instead aid you, Doctor.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Talk 4                      | Doctor, I noticed a trend in the operators in Rhodes Island.. are they all *Leremkovi*? No? Interesting.. I'll ask *Olivia* about this sometime.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Talk after Promotion 1      | *Olivia* forwarded be some work from Rhine Lab, and it actually made me see some similarities between them and *Carbine*. Maybe even all these lightyears away from each other, things aren't too different.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Talk after Promotion 2      | You hide behind the mask, but I can see even in your eyes what you long to ask me. I will forever long to return to *Lúniks*, but I've adapted to life on *Terra* properly, too. The knowledge I have acquired in my past years are beneficial to the research taking place in Rhodes Island and Rhine Lab. It's a difficult path, but it's one I will walk without looking back. |
| Talk after Trust Increase 1 | You make me wonder, Doctor, is there something you're hiding behind your back? Whether it's Rhodes Island's mission, its relations with the other countries, or the underlying imminence of Catastrophies, I feel like there's something rooted even deeper than that.                                                                                                            |
| Talk after Trust Increase 2 | I wish I'd gotten the opportunity to meet *Kristen*. I recognise a portion of myself in the stories about her that I've been told. A longing dream to reach into space, and see the beauty that lies behind. There's questions that remain unanswered, like what lies behind the *Skypod*, but I'll save you my knowledge. Unless you're into nightmares?                         |
| Talk after Trust Increase 3 | I feel like I've gotten more adjusted to being on land again. It's not only *Kal'tsit* that's helped me adjust, but *Olivia*, *Saria*, and *Muelsyse* have come in touch with me more frequently as well. Even if it's a tough pill to swallow, Rhode Island is starting to become my home, now.                                                                                  |
| Idle                        | ..You're sleeping? I'll handle this pile of papers, Doctor. You can take a deserved break.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Onboard                     | I'm Maria Limáida, aerospace and aeronautical researcher from *Carbine Industries*. I look forward to working together with you, Doctor.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Watching Battle Record      | It's a necessary evil. I understand.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Promotion 1                 | Promotion? I'm glad to hear my work is effective, that means I'm adapting properly to the workflow within Rhodes Island. I'll use this as a new foundation for myself to improve on, for the benefit of everyone else.                                                                                                                                                            |
| Promotion 2                 | Even if the period has been short, the skills attained have been grand. Our ideals match, Doctor, and I will fight alongside you to reach our common goal together. If a similar issue would make an appearance on *Lúniks*, I'm sure the roles would be reversed.                                                                                                                |
| Added to Squad              | I will aid where necessary.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Appointed as Squad Leader   | I've stood here before. Let's go.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
