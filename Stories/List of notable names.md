# Interplanetary Travel

## ELE - Earth-Luniks Express
Soon after Luniks was first settled, it became a top priority to establish a stable and steady connection between the two planets. Initially, the travel ports were build and activated between Switzerland and Nóve Rejkjavík, with many other ports quickly being built afterwards to allow a smooth transfer of many people that had an intent to move to Luniks and help settle the young planet. Because of its rapid activation, Luniks could grow as quickly as it has.

**ELE** travels through the wormhole that's also referred to as the *Panjit Loop*, which is named after **Tagip Panjit**, who was the key factor to discovering the necessary steps towards fast interplanetary travel and enabled travel to Luniks in the first place.


# Rail Services
Each nation has their own national railway, which will slowly spring to life as this document evolves, but until then, the existing rail companies and lines are described in this section. 

Despite being set in the near future where space travel is a reality, travel by train has stayed relatively the same, albeit more dense and more important.  
  
Separate passenger and cargo corridors were created in order to make passenger and cargo transport completely independent of one another. Having survived a bankruptcy on Earth, Railpool has found its place in cargo transport throughout and between Thórirsant and Kérisant, maintaining a tight connection and almost exclusive use of Siemens locomotives.
## LTS - Lúnikska Trén Service
LTS as a company frequently reappears throughout the story, although it only services connections between the various nations on **Ubunia**. 

## RKU - Rail Klaszi Ubunia
RKU provides international services between **Thórirsant**, **Kérisant**, and **Zakh'háfo**, providing both cargo and passenger transport.

## Vestia Rapid / Vestia Regio
Vestia Rapid is the high-speed train service that operates between the various nations across Vestia. Its connections range from **Hédenis** and **Mónsan**, through **Zhuehai**, **Álusken**, and **Vao**, with split connections to **Benelux** and **Denmark**. Its most known for the fatal rail incident ever since its inauguration, as described in [[Journey - Luna#SPAD (Signal Passed At Danger)]]. 

Currently planned (December 2023) is developing a brand identity for this service. Taken from the Trello board: \
*Existing concept is a slogan of “Wherever you're going, we'll bring you there”, or "Across the road or across the border, we'll bring you there." Some examples include:* \
"Whether you're going to:
- Sui Donnore
- Ippavím 
- Myriapolou
- Shánzhe
- Lëtzebuerg
- Matéiazhu

We'll bring you there."

*Alternatively, this list of examples can also be exchanged for simply a list of cities that are connected to Vestia Rapid. Next to that, Vestia Rapid can also be transformed into a general rail company, also providing a means of regional and intercity transport without incredible speeds as their VR20s. However, this might need a rebrand, and exchange the "Rapid" name for something else, such as "Vestia Regio".*

Planned is a combination of purple and grey colours with stock high speed rail footage. Just like now LTS banners were proposed and created as a concept, the same process should happen for the brand identity of Vestia Rapid.

## Máneán Metro
**Máneán Metro** (Metro da Máneá) is the umbrella name for all the metro services that it provides in the various cities in what once was **United Máneá**, such as the *Álef Metro*, *Fsat-Hokh Metro*, or even the unique, single-line, *Kristensend Metro*. The one charm that all of these unique metro lines have in common, is that they're fully autonomous. In fears that there would once day be staff shortages and that some lines would end up abandoned, its government had rallied to invest into autonomous services. After the **Collapse of United Máneá** in 2039, the lines continued to service every city as normal, and continued to do so for many decades onwards.


# Ship Services
Only a couple of cargo services by ship exist throughout all of Lúniks. This is because overseas shipment has mostly been replaced by solar plane cargo.

## Álusken-Thórirsant Ferry
A ferry (rather, a cruise ship) connects the two continents of Ubunia and Vestia, providing a ferry both ways every 3 hours. 


# Common Brands
## Esti
**Esti** is a worldwide supermarket chain that originated in **Thórirsant**, and has tagged along with every new nation that sprung up ever since the settlement of Lúniks, to become the backbone of every newly developing nation. 

## Norden Supermarkets
Prominent in the north of Álusken (Hence the name **Norden**) is **Norden Supermarktir**, which have been established soon after the handover from *Queen Álusken I's* reign to that of *King Álusken II*, who then attempted to get rid of every sort of modern service since the start of his reign. In a desperate attempt to survive, Norden opened its first few markets in the south of **Vao**, and once it became clear that the plans that King Álusken II had made would be limited to within the boundaries of the capital, Norden quickly returned to the north of Álusken, where it has since outgrown its competitors.

## Hammerhead Industries
**Hammerhead** is a Vestian industry appliances manufacturer, who is best known for snowballing the expansion and normalisation of the settlement of Vestia, soon after the borders were drawn upon landing on Lúniks. 
### History
Founded in **2013**, **Hammerhead** settled itself outside of the **Zhuehai** city of **Shánzhe**. Ever since, its first and only goal was to expand as rapidly and as efficiently as possible, and enormous factories, airfields, and factories sprung up in the far outskirts of Shánzhe, giving it its temporary skyline. In **2019**, the immense construction of factories and facilities was completed. Not too long afterwards, the production of satellites and means of travel for on Lúniks was carried over to Hammerhead from the ESA. This gradual transition went through until **2031**, which was when the ESA formally handed over its facilities and control centres to be based in Shánzhe, completing the now 40-year-long mission to fully settle another planet.
### Starship development
From **2019** through **2031**, Hammerhead's primary focus was retrofitting the four existing **Starships**, modernising them as times evolved and keeping them in their best shape for frequent travel between Earth and Lúniks. Additionally, They also begun their iterations of **Four**, and developed the next generation of Starships that would serve as a means of passenger transport while the **ELE Corridor**, another Hammerhead project, was still undergoing development. After the **ELE Corridor** had been completed, they once more retrofitted the now-old Starships and the next generation of Starships, to supply the necessary cargo between the two planets for the **ESA handover** in **2031**.
### Alkéisa's Ring
From **2025** through **2037**, Hammerhead's various departments also laid their focus on developing **Alkéisa's Ring**. More info in this is available at [[Alkéisa's Ring, 2037]].
### Rail Networks
From **2018** onwards, Hammerhead had been a key factor in developing the immense rail networks that are present on the continent of **Vestia**. Next to manufacturing the trains and tracks in use by **Vestia Rapid/Regio**, it has also developed various technologies that support Maglev trains, a technology that was picked up from Asian projects. 
### Weaponry
After the **2031** handover, in **2035**, Hammerhead laid their eyes on producing firearms in hopes to expertise themselves in every possible field of work. Next to efficient rifles and handguns, this sparked the development of **Pulse Rifles**, a type of weapon that has become incredibly prominent since the **2050s**. These rifles were **non-lethal**, which sparked their interest as a means of self-defence. But Pulse Rifles aside, they also produce an immense arsenal of firearms, ranging from pistols the size of a hand, to rifles that can make a target unrecognisable at a 3km distance.
#### Known Arsenal
- **HR75** (**Heavy Rifle class 75**): A top-of-the-line bolt-action sniper rifle with expert power and precision. With a length of almost 190cm from barrel to stock, this rifle supports .50cal cartridges and a versatile platform of extensions that cater to your needs. 
- **HR62** (**Heavy Rifle Class 62**): 
- **SR43** (**Standard Rifle class 43**): When you need a rifle that does exactly what you require it to do, the SR43 fits all of your needs, even if they frequently change. Supporting a wide variety of cartridges and extensions, the versatile SR43 has your back, wherever your mission may take you.
- **SP14** (**Standard Pistol class 14**): (Iterated Five-seveN)
- **MPC5** (**Micro Pistol Class 5**): Don't let its size fool you. At the size of a hand, the MPC5 still delivers significant firepower.
- **PZ25** (**Pulse Class 25**): Your new best friend. Developed and iterated internally at Hammerhead for over 10 years, the PZ25 is the incredible result of endless hard work to bring you pulse weaponry in a compact, accessible form factor.
- **PZ55** (**Pulse Class 55**): (Visual reference: Apex Nemesis Rifle)
- **EPZ90** (***Experimental* Pulse Class 90**): (Railgun prototype)

## Carbine
Next to offering a varied catalogue of weapons, **Carbine** is on the hunt to reach the same level of market share that **Hammerhead** currently has. Jealous of their achievements, Carbine entered the experimental weapon department, in hopes to create a new image for themselves where they failed trying to chase after Hammerhead. 

## Ódóni Industries
Once based in **United Máneá**, **Ódóni** supplied the technologies that were needed for research in **Amadnésam**. After the collapse of **United Máneá**, Ódóni fled to **Rhódisz**, together with a number of other industries and companies in hopes to escape from the collapsing economy and increasing crime rates. The Ódóni tower, where the research once took place, was locked down, but since **2062**, it has been reactivated, and has since been the centre of **Neurokick** production.
