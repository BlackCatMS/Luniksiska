# Lúniks Timeline
Considering the rapid discovery and rapid colonisation of the exoplanet, now known as Lúniks, some dates need to be moved back in time, meaning this becomes a complete alternate universe that diverges from our existing one at around 1980 (**1978**). 

## 1978 - End of Cold War
Halfway through the year **1978**, the Cold War reaches its end, as all involved nations shake their hands and agree on peace terms, promising benefits for all of humanity, and not just those in charge. As a result of this, the technologies developed by various space agencies, such as the American **NASA**, the European **ESA**, and Indian **ISRO**, also agreed to exchange their current projects regarding rocket propulsion technologies that saw use in the launch of **ICBM**s in favour of space travelling technologies. Where the *Space Race* had once ended after the **US** landed on the moon with *Apollo 11*, there were more pieces to be picked up and more opportunities to be taken.

## 1986 - ESA begins Exoplanet research
With **NASA** laying their focus on research of our own planet, and **ISRO** beginning preparations for lunar research, the **ESA** embarks on a journey to find a needle in a haystack like never before. Under guidance of *Jonathán Thórirsonn*, the research team in Geneva begins to develop and activate various satellites and research elements that will assist them in finding planets similar to Earth, and hoping to find a planet that could serve as the next home of humanity.

## 1990 - Panjit disbands with ISRO, PALMER-EDEN is founded
While no specific date is made public, the pharmaceutical company **PALMER-EDEN** is founded in **Chicago** at the start of this year, quickly spreading throughout the country in no-time and besides pharmacies, quickly provided services in almost every branche imaginable. Within just a year, its tight grip in the market increased and only got stronger, leading to various safety and privacy concerns now that one single company nearly controlled the entire US market, and sooner or later, big companies begin to close their doors in the US and move to other, safer countries, fearing that PALMER-EDEN would take control of them as well.

Across the globe, science prodigy **Tagip Panjit** breaks ties with the **ISRO**, and instead moves to the **ESA** in Geneva to assist the various teams there with research. Panjit is believed to be on the doorstep on cracking the code regarding *FTL (Faster than Light)* space travel, and with the **ISRO** focusing exclusively on moon missions, the **ESA** and them manage to close the trade, giving Panjit the development headroom and support that he needed.

## 1994 - Lúniks is discovered, US braindrain continues
In late **1994**, *Thórirsonn* and his team laid their eyes on the solar system of **Choreos** once more, having labelled points of interest on **RP-3** and **RP-4**, both of them sharing characteristics with Earth. With the limited data that they had, and with **Hubble** giving them information as far as it possibly could, the team decides to risk it all, and the research of the teams in Lappland and Geneva shift towards learning more about these strange planets, and how they could possibly reach them within the current generation.

Across the globe, **PALMER-EDEN** continues to hammer down on the US market, having been denied expansion across the borders into the rivalling markets of Mexico, Canada, and China. With the increased security risks of a single company managing a monopoly on every imaginable branche, more and more high-level institutes take their leave, and begin to flee to its neighbouring nation **Canada**, or flee across the sea to **Japan**, **China**, or to **Europe**.

## 1995 - FTL Travel simulation a success, NASA departs US
Following many other large institutes and companies, **NASA** officially departs the US in early **1995**, closing their doors and leaving their control centres and launch sites to collect dust as its many employees instead seek a continuation for their research in the respective space agencies in **Europe** and **China**, and the old Apollo team finds their new home in Bengaluru with the **ISRO**. 

In **Geneva**, the research team put Panjit's theories and hypotheses to the test and simulated them at **CERN**, and proves that he had been on the right track with his theories the entire time. Successfully, the research team simulated the opening of a proposed "Loop", that would open up a wormhole and reduce the travel time from Lúniks from over 6 years, to a mere few minutes. 

## 1996 - Probe reaches Lúniks successfully
Following various test protocols and trials to try and successfully open and close the **Panjit Loop** from Geneva, a single transmitter probe is launched into orbit and eventually sent through the Loop, where it will transmit a message towards Earth, and then get brought back to return to orbit. 

## 1997 - NASA and ESA merge in Geneva/Lyon
After having fled from the imminent collapse of the **United States**, and preventing a buyout from PALMER-EDEN in **1995**, **NASA** joins forces with the **ESA** in **Geneva** two years after. Together, the teams from **NASA** are relocated to various research stations, and help with the research and analyses of Lúniks, and also the approach of developing satellites that can reach Lúniks properly and safely for further research. With their strengths combined, the estimated arrival of humanity on Lúniks is shifted forwards to **2005**, instead of the original estimation of **2009**.

## 1999 - Ubunian allocation is drafted
In late **1999**, after the continents of Lúniks received their name, the first borders were drawn on the continent of **Ubunia**, where the first Starship, **One**, is set to land in just a few years away. Only a few nations were drawn on the map at this stage, especially research still working overtime to determine whether it was possible to have **One** survive a jump through the **Panjit Loop** at all, but as a start, it was better than nothing.

## 2000 - Lappland discovers life on Lúniks
After keeping an eye on **Ubunia** for a number of years, lander **ELL-1** is sent to land near the plains of Kastávje. Monitored by the **Lappland Observatory**, it discovers life just a mere few minutes after landing near a forest, hearing the echoes of what is presumed to *deer* and the chirps of what is presumed to be from a type of *bird*. 

## 2001 - Vestian allocation is drafted, US closes borders
With the borders on Ubunia nearing completion, the next continent to be drafted and allocated was **Vestia**. With many nations from Earth carrying over to Lúniks for a better shot at a proper livelihood for its citizens, nations like **Taiwan**, **Denmark**, **Greece** and the **Benelux**, were given locations on the Vestia that they could settle, thus drawing and forming the borders accordingly.

On the other side of the globe, **PALMER-EDEN**, now in control of the vast majority of the US, closes the borders, preventing any citizen and organisation from entering and leaving the country until further notice. 

## 2004 - Deónian forests discovered
Observed by the **Lappland Observatory** is **OTL-4**, which has been keeping its eyes and sensors on the continents of **Skádia** and **Deónia** since its activation upon reaching Lúniks. In **2004**, it discovers a nature reserve that is believed to be extremely vital to the health of the planet, and while the allocation of **Skádia** was undergoing planning, the **Lappland Observatory** requested an immediate halt, in order to prevent the reserve from getting damaged, or outright destroyed.

## 2005 - Exploration mission, **One** lands on Lúniks
In early **2005**, an exploration mission is sent to Lúniks for humanity's first steps on an exoplanet, carrying a research team and the discoverer of the planet, *Jonathán Thórirsonn*. They successfully set the first steps through two flights through the **Panjit Loop**, and prove that it is indeed possible to settle another planet, and that Lúniks is the perfect planet for humanity to settle. 

On **September 15th, 2005**, the first settlement ship **One** lands on Lúniks, completing the decade-long mission to settle another planet. But where one mission ends, the next one begins.

## 2006 - Ubunian allocation begins
On **January 1st, 2006**, not too long after the first settlement ship had landed on Lúniks and the nation of Thórirsant began development, the rest of **Ubunia** began allocation, and **Two** was set to carry over many more future inhabitants of the new planet. The borders had been drawn many years before, and were now beginning to be enforced as the new nations sprung up and bloomed to life.

## 2009 - Vestian allocation begins
After the **Ubinian Allocation** had been completed in late **2008**, **Vestia** was due next. Now familiar with the process of allocating a continent, it took merely a year to fully allocate Vestia, and with the refurbishment of **Two**, more and more frequent flights happened between **Shánzhe** and **Lyon**, granting more opportunities for the blooming continent to grow even more rapidly than before.

## 2025 - Alkéisa's Ring begins development
With unlimited help in construction from **Hammerhead**, **Matéus Alkéisa** completes his thesis on how to build a planetary ring to protect and aid Lúniks where needed. Now that local space travel has been made easily accessible, **Hammerhead** begins its own research on how to approach the absurd amount of materials required to build a ring that surrounds the entire planet. Deciding on using the lifeless planet of *Choreos-RP-3* to mine the required materials, work quickly begins to accomplish this immense feat of engineering.

## 2031 - ESA hands over space management to Hammerhead

## 2033 - ELE Corridor opens, connecting the planets
In **2033**, the first connection between Earth and Lúniks officially opened, connecting the blooming cities of Lyon and Nóve Réjkjavik with each other. Over the next few months, it would also connect Lyon to Shánzhe and Kérisant-Civem. In the next few years, more and more connections would bloom up throughout nations in Europe and Asia, making travelling between Lúniks and Earth increasingly accessible as time went on.

## 2035 - United States collapses
Follows up **US unrest after PALMER-EDEN** and **Secession of Illinois**. A more concrete timeline and more information will be available at [[Collapse of United States]].

## 2037 - Alkéisa's Ring is activated

## 2039 - United Máneá collapses
Follows up **Zakh'háfon independence movement** and **Nikec Kráminsz murders**. A more concrete timeline and more information will be available at [[Collapse of United Máneá]].

## 2062 - PALMER-EDEN attempts expansion

## 2071 - Choreos-RP-3 begins settlement concepts
The century-long journey and mission of settling an exoplanet never really reached an end. While **Lúniks**, **Choreos-RP-4**, originally was the main mission goal to reach and settle, the journey didn't end there. In **2071**, long after the first spaceships had landed on Lúniks, **Hammerhead Shánzhe** set its eyes to Lúniks's sister planet, **Choreos-RP-3**, which had originally been mined and excavated in order to build **Alkéisa's Ring**. After further research, the Hammerhead team learned that despite the intensive mining having taken place, it still seemed in prime condition to support life, and now that Lúniks had been settled successfully and is thriving, the next chapter seems to draw closer.



### First wave of the Luniksan revolution (2005-2016)
Described in [[Kérisant#Kérisant-Civem (Capital)]] the first wave of the Luniksan revolution was the first wave in which cities and smaller villages bloomed and were built as quick as possible. Once a decent portion of humanity moved to Luniks and its newly-built cities, the wave reached an end and the excessive construction slowed down. The second wave occurred soon after, in approx. 2022, and saw more creative and futuristic design languages and architecture take shape. The original and initial wave of construction that shaped the first cities of Luniks remained, giving cities a core center with older architecture, similarly to the majority of Europe.

### Second wave of the Luniksan revolution (2022-2032)
The second wave of Luniksan revolution was mostly aimed at building more sustainably, while also creating much more homes and places of comfort for the ever-growing planet of Luniks. Cities doubled in size almost every year, which meant the planet needed rapid action, but also rapid construction. This second wave of Luniksan building caused a spike in architecture, as function was paired with form, creating a set of futuristic but desolate spaces with enormous appartement complexes and towers in the second ring of cities. This revolution slowed down again in around 2030, as the influx of new inhabitants also decreased. 


### Modern Luniks (2032-)
**Modern Luniks** is described as the period after the various cities and nations were formed and founded, and every territory had been laid out in peace. The enormous economic boom that took place in the founding ~30 years reaches an end, and normality, similar to that on Earth, begins.

**Modern Luniks** is also where all of the stories that are documented take place in.
