# GLIMMER
Within Ghost Temples, a **Glimmer** is understood simply as a memorable moment that occurred at one point in a Ghost's life. These may be considered as everyday activities, such as *forest walks* for Winter, *painting* for Snow, and so forth. This document will capture all these various glimmers of the various Ghosts, and give a glimpse of their new lives.

## The Dream Pursued (Working title)
### GLIMMER // SPARK
*// POV: Spark*   
  
Ever since, it'd been a few weeks since I got emotional in Winter's arms. Occasionally, we'd walk through the forests together and share stories that we still remembered, we laughed, we cried, but we held hands throughout the journey for answers, and for new possibilities. With new memories being made, they drowned out the old ones that had haunted me from day one, the thoughts of my death, the vivid memories and pain that persisted every time my mind replayed it before my eyes. It'd been about 5 days since I last had an anxiety attack induced by those memories, but with Winter holding me tightly the entire time, they only lasted a fraction of what they once did. Now that I was gradually beginning to improve and feel at home in my new life, I no longer felt the need to smoke as much as I did before. Here and there, it did soothe and ease my mind just enough to get a moment of peace, but even if it couldn't physically hurt me anyway, it still left a bad taste in my mouth. It was a necessary evil, but with the evil beginning to get suppressed by natural means, I no longer needed to smoke to help it.  
  
With a deep sigh, I picked up the guitar from the floor as I waited outside the library. I had my routine checkups with Marten and Sóvis just now, and they continued to puzzle away at why my memories were so vivid and vibrant, and why my pain and scars refused to heal. I felt like they were reaching a dead end, and even with Matéis coming over from Álusken, I began to wonder if it was really worth it to undergo all this effort now that I started feeling at home anyway. I'd adapted to the pain, and made sure to not press on my shoulder and chest, the places my dad's blade struck, too much. But Sóvis desperately wanted, needed answers, and I didn't want to get in his way either.  
  
Hesitantly, I began to pluck the strings of the guitar, its familiar and characteristic sound echoing quietly through the hallway while I quickly try to tune it to perfection. It'd been a long while since I had picked up the guitar, and especially with the close link to all the haunting memories that accompanied the guitar, I was afraid to pick it up as well. Every time I tried, it would merely trigger my anxiety, but with Winter by my side, my confidence overcame my anxiety, and I picked up where I had left off from. \  
Winter had told me about a few of the songs she sang while on forest walks, and together, we'd try to create a fitting melody with my guitar or my violin, creating a new song inspired by an older, existing one, continuing on from where we were robbed off of before our deaths. But before I could properly play and practice with my guitar, I heard the library door open next to me, with Marten stepping out to get my attention. **"Spark, I believe we figured it out, come along."**  
  
Placing my guitar back on the floor beside the bench, I promptly followed after Marten. At the desk, I could see the various notes that Matéis and Sóvis were working with, but hearing the door close, Sóvis turns around to face me, immediately locking eyes with mine. **"U-uh.. Spark, this might be a little tricky to explain, but I'll give my best effort."** He said, standing up from his chair and stepping towards me. *"Is it.. bad..?"* I asked, the atmosphere getting more tense as his voice began to worry me. \  
**"It depends."** He begins, resting his arm gently on my left, scarred shoulder, **"Simply put, I had come just a little too soon to guide you through your Rebirth. I happened to be nearby when I heard your soul cry for help, but with how quick I was there, your soul hadn't been completely freed just yet. That's why your memories are still vivid, and why your body is still scarred and in pain."**  
His hand began to glow a feint, golden colour, slowly beginning to pulse onto my shoulder, soothing the pain and easing up the scar. Nodding slowly, I waited for him to continue, listening eagerly and understandingly. **"We've helped you wherever possible to ease the pain, but with your condition improving now you're frequently getting along with Winter, it seems to have begun healing naturally. We'll still help you heal where needed, but with the way you're adapting, nature should do just enough, and your true soul will make itself present in due time."** Sóvis finished, a wide smile on his face as he moved his hand off my shoulder, gently brushing my cheek as I blushed slightly at the thoughts of spending more time with Winter. *"H-How does my.. true soul.. form.. look like, though?"* I asked, curiosity getting the better of me. **"Only time can tell,"** Sóvis replied, giving me a sense of hope and comfort that I hadn't properly felt from him this way since my Rebirth, **"But with Winter by your side, you'll turn out beautiful, that's for sure."**
