# GHOST TEMPLES
**Location**: Spread out throughout the entire planet of Luniks (With a planned expansion on Earth)

The **Ghost Temples** are located throughout the planet in various desolate places, such as old forests, empty grass fields, or hidden right in the heart of a blooming temples. Unbeknownst to the masses of people on Luniks, the ghosts themselves find their home in these temples.

Observed by the sun *Choreos*, guarded by the moon *Jerrát*, the Temples find themselves on an **elevated plane of existence**. Commonly understood is that the Ghost Temples are an **"Elevated Realm"**, while the world below — the everyday life on Luniks — is the **"Lower Realm"**. This means that any changes that happen on Luniks, are mirrored into the elevated realm where the Ghost Temples find themselves in, but any Temples that are settled, and any homes that are built, do not reflect to the lower realm. 

**Cziskvelén** was the first Ghost to set foot in this Elevated Realm after his death on the Lower Realm. During his rebirth, it was explained to him by the **Higher Spirit**, the **Eye of Chroma**, that he now possessed a power to guide many more people that lost their lives in the Lower Realm upwards to the Elevated Realm, to continue their lives "as normal", and to grant them a chance to continue their lives after having them taken from them too soon in life. 


# The Lifecycle
Every ghost has gone through three stages upon introduction to their new Temple. These are:
## Last Light
**Last Light** refers to the last light the existing ghosts saw before dying and being reborn. This means that every corresponding entry will document the very last moments of their previous identities. Examples being *Luna*, who lost their life on the fatal **Vestia Rapid Train incident**, and *Snow*, who lost her life through being at the wrong place at the wrong time. All that they have in common is that they were granted a next chance and were granted shelter in the Ghost Temples.

Before entering the Temple, they are approached by a Guardian of their respective Temple, which gives them the capabilities and strength to undergo the process of rebirth. This is always traditionally done at the same location of the accident, that unfortunately cost them their lives. The location is completely devoided of any other humans or animals, and a white mist will linger around the Guardian and the soon-to-be Ghost.
## Rebirth
**Rebirth** refers to the rebirth of those that died in accidents of no fault of their own, and were granted another chance to live through the process of rebirth, granted by a Temple Guardian. In standard cases, Temple Guardians choose the most pure souls that were robbed of the proper, long life that they deserved and died too soon in an accident or circumstance they had no control over. This includes accidents like the **2074 Matéiazhu Rail Disaster**, and the **2075 Keustellet missile strike**, where *Luna* and *Snow* lost their lives, respectively. 

Upon rebirth, a newly born Ghost is introduced to their new Guardian, that will introduce them to their new life and explain in a light amount of detail what had happened to them in their past one. As all Ghosts struggle with amnesia, where all memories but the Last Light rapidly vanish upon rebirth, this means it will both be easy yet hard for them to adapt to their new lives. 
## Exposure
**Exposure** refers to the event in which everything clicks together. Every memory that was able to be restored from the rescued soul has been restored, and the new Ghost has now been permanently connected to their corresponding Temple.
## Glimmer
A **Glimmer** is understood simply as a memorable moment that occurred at one point in a Ghost's life. These may be considered everyday activities, such as *forest walks* for **Winter**, *painting* for **Snow**, and so forth. These glimmers will capture all these various experiences and moments of the various Ghosts, and give a glimpse of their new lives.
## Current Exceptions
*// While Ghost Temples is undergoing a rework in how the documents and stories are ordered, outliers remain, and are described as follows:*
### First Light
**First Light** is the event in which **Cziskvelén**, and later **Vászi**, received their powers from **Chroma** to shape their *Elevated Realm* they found themselves in to support new Ghosts through their new lives. *// Currently, both of these First Lights are exclusively available at [[FIRST LIGHT]], but may be moved elsewhere later on.*
### Closure
**Closure** is the event in which a Ghost succumbs to the void, their "second chance" at life having reached fulfillment, and the Ghost promptly bids farewell to the *Elevated Realm*, and dies of natural causes. Currently, only **Cziskvelén** has gone through this, bidding farewell to **Vászi** and **Chroma**. Said story is available at [[CLOSURE]].
### Despair
***DESPAIR** // The stage in which the quality of life of the Ghost or Temple is rapidly declining and in danger of running out.* // The **DESPAIR** entry is currently used in *DESPAIR // VÁSZI*, carrying a different meaning.
- **DESPAIR // VÁSZI**, which uses the alternative meaning for **DESPAIR**, is available at [[DESPAIR]].


## A Quick Rundown
The current focus lays on the **Temple of Vestia**, where a small group of characters is actively being developed and have sprung to life. This list of characters is still rapidly growing, but is available at [[Stories/GHOST TEMPLES/Character List|Character List]], as well as under its corresponding header in the current page. 

Each Temple has a **Settler**, which reflects in the symbol that is created upon the foundation of the temple, and will forever be stored as a *plaque* within the *Memorial Hall*. Within this Hall, all spirits of present and past Ghosts are available, as well as basic information regarding the temple and its symbols. The symbols are properly explained at [[Scattered Info#Known Symbols]].

Every **Ghost** has a unique set of abilities and powers that they either acquired through experience in their new realm, or were carried over during *Rebirth*. These abilities are referred to as [[SIGNATURES]], and require a varying amount of *Spiritual Energy* before they can be activated. 

A **Settler** possesses a tremendously high amount of *Spiritual Energy*, the same energy that forms around a Guardian's Signature *Guarding Light*. In order to become a **Settler** and settle your own Temple, *Guardianship* is a requirement, which is why many Ghosts choose to go through Guardian Apprenticeship, in order to gain the required knowledge, but also the required skills and power, to settle a Temple close to their birthplace, or place of death. 

**Cziskvelén** and **Vászi** are the Settlers of the *Temple of Vestia*. It's widely believed that **Cziskvelén** was granted his Guardianship by a higher, unknown power, which he himself referred to as *"The Higher Spirit"*, and passed this knowledge onto Vászi before settling the *Temple of Vestia*. However, as the *Temple of Zhuehai* is much older, there is also a legend that **Cziskvelén** is the *Higher Spirit* himself, and has since guided Settlers like **Guǎnzhù**, **Matéis**, and **Yun Li** to settle their own Temples first, before disappearing after the *Temple of Álusken* was settled.


## A Brief Timeline
### First Light
**First Light** is the most commonly used term to describe the legend of *Cziskvelén*, as he is widely renowned for being the first Ghost to have settled a Temple, the **Temple of Chroma**. Many years after his rebirth into a ghost, he settles the **Temple of Zhuehai** together with *Yun Li*, which is widely believed to be the oldest Temple still standing and still active to this day.
### Era of Vászi & Matéis
Together with *Cziskvelén*, *Vászi* settles the **Temple of Vestia** and *Matéis* settles the **Temple of Álusken**, where they both stay as Temple Guardians respectively as Cziskvelén departs into the unknown, disappearing for many years to come.
### Marten's Guardianship 
As the focus lays on the **Temple of Vestia**, *Marten* is reborn into a ghost, maintaining his original name from before his death. During this time, *Sóvis* joins the Guardianship, while *Átem* instead leaves, and *Luna* and *Snow* are reborn under this Temple.
### Era of Marten & Sóvis
Many months later, *Marten* and *Sóvis* near the end of their Guardianship, while *Vászi* begins to prepare for his departure from the **Temple of Vestia** for a final time, after *Matéis* had picked up a signal from *Cziskvelén*, far beyond the Morrésik mountains. Haphazardly, Marten and Sóvis are promoted to **Temple Guardians** at the help of Matéis, and sooner or later begin getting the hang of being a Tempel Guardian. During this era, *Raine*, *Winter*, and *Spark* are reborn under this Temple.
