# RAINE
## REBIRTH // RAINE
### A Voice Who Called
*POV: Raine* \
With a deep sigh, I picked the jar of pasta sauce from the cabinet in the supermarket. I personally despised making myself pasta, but with guests coming over, I had to please the guests as well, knowing that Michael surely wouldn't mind me going outside of my comfort box with dinner. A few steps northbound, I headed to the meat section of the store, taking a simple box of ground beef, betting on having some left over beef to treat myself and Michael with something special, just for the two of us. From the thought alone, my cheeks turn into a deep red, imagining all the things I could make, the smile on his face as he would take his first bite, oh, how romantical!

But it wasn't until I reached the last aisle that I started to realise things were off. Taking a wine bottle off the shelf as the cherry on the cake, I saw something off in the centre of my eye. Colours were starting to get more muted, the noise of the crowd within the supermarket began to fade out. The combined noise of every customer chatting in a casual, friendly way with the others, began to rapidly fade into the same sound. 

*"Is what you see real?"* I suddenly heard a voice say right behind me, causing me to nearly drop the bottle of wine I was holding out of pure fear. With a gulp, I turn around, ready for the worst, but ultimately seeing, nothing? The voices started to echo around me, from every direction, as I quickly placed the bottle back on the shelf. *"Are you paying attention?"* I felt my heard pounding in my chest, fear reaching levels I never knew it could reach. *"Do not be afraid"*, the voices began to whisper. *"Your help is here."* I began to frantically look around, trying to find out if this was an elaborate prank being pulled on me. *"Czu onan visés?"* Trying to speak, to yell out, I find my voice lost from the sheer amount of fear and anxiety rushing through my veins, as the voices start to repeat the same thing, again and again. *"Fear not, Raine."*

My eyes fixate on the main entrance of the small supermarket, right behind the checkout section, where a cloaked figure had appeared. My fear reached even higher levels than before, the strange figure gradually making their way towards me, showing no intent of stopping, but weirdly enough, no intent of harm either. The colours began to fade completely, until every colour became a mixture of greyscale and muted, dark colours. White fog began to fill the supermarket, sending chills through my body, before realising it was beginning to rain. I suddenly heard the steps of the figure before me, his appearance becoming more clear to me, even despite the lack of colour. But that didn't matter, they were wearing a black harness, a bright, white mantle, and a creepy, plain white mask. Before realising it would be impossible to rain inside a supermarket, the steps stopped, as the figure stood still, reaching their hand out, and breaking the silence.

**"Please, do not be afraid. I am here to guide you through this, Raine."**

With the lump still well and present high up in my throat, I do my best to swallow it away, failing in the process. Keeping myself from coughing violently, I take a deep breath, and finally decide to reach out my hand towards the creepy white figure before me, managing to spurt out a few words as I gently hold his hand, as careful as I can be. \
*"Y-you.. won't kill me.. right..?"* \
**"I'm afraid we're already past that stage. This will be your revival."**

An ice cold breeze immediately rushed throughout the supermarket, the rain becoming even colder, with his words echoing through the aisles and walls. "Past that stage"? Just what was this guy on? Every single thought dashed across and through my head. Had I died? When? How? Just what happened? Is this a joke, was this an out of season prank? I had a bad relationship with the neighbours two doors down, but this would be out of this world, even for them! \
Doing my absolute best to keep my tears at bay, keeping myself from panicking or collapsing under my fears, I whisper under my breath, my eyes tracing down from the luminescent mask, down to his pitch-black harness. \
*"W-what..?"*

Without hesitation the figure before me replies, and begins to explain. His tone of voice stayed the same; Cold and otherwise emotionless, but oddly warm, as if he really intended to help me through this. As he began to speak, I tried to go through every memory I had made in my life, but struggling to properly picture them before me. The first kiss with Michael, meeting his parents for the first time, all the way to our honeymoon, but as I envisioned every memory, I quickly began to realise that that would be my last ever time seeing those memories. The colours began to mute and grey out, before the pictures themselves began to burn away, holes forming, before the entire memory would be burned away from my mind, lost in the infinite sea of thoughts.

**"There is no easy way for me to say this, Raine. You had just been assassinated, wrongly. You looked identical to a Mafia target. The shooter had misjudged."** \
*"S-so.. now..?"* \
**"It means you were killed wrongly, and it wouldn't be right for us to let your life go to waste like this."** 

With a quick, but careful motion, he takes his left hand and slowly presses it on his mask. Within a second, the mask lets go, as he brings it down, revealing his face to me, a warm, inviting smile having been kept hidden behind the mask, nestled within a ruffled beard. The rain in the supermarket quickly came to a stop, the white mist that had formed slowly began to dissipate, as I felt a strange, and especially mysterious ray of warmth encompass me while tears began to stream down my cheeks. A mixture of hope and grief rushing through my blood. 

**"My name is Sóvis, the Guardian of the Temple of Vestia. I'd like to guide you through this sudden change, Raine, you are deserving of this second life."**
