# GHOST TEMPLES // CHARACTERS
This Character List belongs to [[GHOST TEMPLES]].

## // Settler of Vászi
### Appearance
As the **Guardian of Vestia**, the *White/Grey* dress code is mandatory for a Guardian to wear. Because of this, Vászi wears a blacked-out and grey harness, over which he wears a robe or mantle, with a collar that extends far out. The outfit is completed by simple, plain white pants.

Vászi bears a **Plain White Mask**. He prefers a featureless mask that hides his expressions and body language while guiding a new ghost through Rebirth. This way, he will give the new ghost the most neutral and natural way to process it all, without giving a first impression, be it good or bad, through an altered and personalised mask.

His name, *Settler of Vászi*, is derived from the area in which he had settled the *Temple of Vestia*, which is located between Álusken and Zhuehai, in a nature reserve that's commonly known as **"The Vászi"**. In both the nations it overlaps and its surrounding nations this name is frequently used, whereas the name **"Váseim"** is used throughout the nations in Ubunia.

### Past Life
Nothing about Vászi's past life is known, as he was the original settler of the Temple of Vestia, together with Cziskvelén. Soon after, Vászi would stay behind to guard the newly-founded temple, while Cziskvelén would continue to roam the nature reserve and ultimately lay ground to the *Temple of Álusken*, where he would share Guardian duties with **Settler Matéis**.

## // Settler Cziskvelén
Cziskvelén is a **Swordsman** and **Settler**, having settled the *Temple of Vestia* alongside Vászi, and the *Temple of Álusken* alongside Matéis. Cziskvelén's life has mostly become a legacy, as he is usually referred to as the "Original Settler", long after the foundation of the *Temple of Zhuehai*, as his own temples would cause more temples to bloom throughout the planet. 

### Appearance
Similarly to **Vászi**, Cziskvelén bears a **Plain White Mask**, albeit more worn down than those of the other Guardians. The Settler's outfit has remained the same as well, even despite his departure to **Chroma**: A White/Grey mantle or robe that wraps around a black harness, which is completed by white pants.

### Past Life
Before being killed and subsequently approached by the **Eye of Chroma**, Cziskvelén was a hitman ([[Nikec Kráminsz]]) in **United Máneá**, soon before it fell. Having gone through blood and sweat without emotions, he initially was confused why he was given the chance to go through Rebirth at all, especially since the targets that he eliminated on Luniks ultimately led to the **Collapse of United Máneá**, but even despite this, **Chroma** knew that Cziskvelén would be the right person to guide others into a new life.

## // Guardian Marten
Rough visual reference: **Ike Eveland** from **Nijisanji**.

Marten, along with a number of others, was a **Junior Guardian** at the Temple of Vestia, up until Vászi's departure. Alongside Sóvis, he studied to become a Temple Guardian in similar fashion to Vászi and Matéis, minus the attire, which he strongly opposes. Unlike Vászi, Marten tends to wear formal clothing, usually meant for winter, that doesn't use the *White/Grey* dress code which is otherwise mandatory for Guardians.

Marten originally did not bear a mask, but has since switched to a **half-Mask**, covering just his mouth and jaw. He did choose to keep this in a pale white, similar to other Temple Guardians, as a form of respect to his *Guardianship*.

Despite the fact he originally was against the established standards within the Temple of Vestia, he does have a good heart and the right mindset to become a Guardian, as seen in **EXPOSURE // SNOW**. This gave Vászi and Matéis enough reason to set forth with his *Guardian Apprenticeship*, and eventual promotion to *Temple Guardian*, a role he would share with **Sóvis**.

### Past Life
Marten is the only ghost (as of Dec 2023) to not be assigned a new name upon Rebirth. In agreement with Vászi, who guided him through Rebirth, he maintained a set of his memories and pursued his original dream career: Guiding and teaching others. At the time of his death, Marten was 26 years old and actively working towards becoming a university teacher in health and community work, amongst studying regular science. In the end, he fell short to his dreams and was diagnosed with heart cancer, and succumbing to it within a year. Because Vászi believed that Marten had a good enough heart with infinite willpower, he offered him to go through Rebirth and guide him to become a Guardian, giving him a second chance at reaching his dreams.

## // Guardian Sóvis
Rough visual reference: Musical artist **Bushbaby**.

Together with **Marten**, Sóvis went through *Guardian Apprenticeship* soon after his own rebirth. With a timid, calm, and friendly personality, both Vászi and Matéis understood that this was the right path for Sóvis, for him to use his good heart to guide others into their new lives as well and take on the Guardian role. 

### Past Life
Before his death, Sóvis was a simple office worker.

### Journey
Sóvis currently has no entries in any of his stages.


## // Luna
Appearance wise, **Luna** can be described as an androgynous person, dressing themselves very nonchalantly and regularly, being very vocal about their strong *distaste* in the traditional clothing of the Guardians and various other ghosts, and continuing to wear the same, basic style of clothing they used to wear before their Last Light. This clothing can be described as far as simple jeans and a hoodie, completed by a navy-blue trenchcoat. 

Luna bears an **Oni Mask**, handcrafted to their preference and integrated a mask featuring *Golden/Red* and Chinese-inspired characters and artworks, as a tribute to the many days they had spent in Matéiazhu ever since being reborn.

Their name is directly derived from **Luna**, Earth's moon. 

### Past Life
Before their death, Luna was still in college, where they studied computer science and intelligence. Unlike their usual appearance, Luna actually dreamed of getting into fashion and starting their own, non-standard clothing brand. The sudden lapse between their death and rebirth gave them the opportunity to utilise their previously gained knowledge about neuroscience and computer intelligence (As seen in their *Curious Eye* Signature), and while they're still very insecure and shy about it, also allows them to experiment with clothing of their own, now that the entire palette and canvas are available to them.

## // Snow
Rough visual reference: **Shirakami Fubuki** from **Hololive**.

**Snow** has primarily worn simple, white dresses and suits ever since her Rebirth, still adapting to her sudden changes, especially those that were brought over through the recovery of her spirit by *Vászi* during her Rebirth. Next to wearing primarily white clothing, she also sports long, wavy white hair and possesses the animal characteristics of an *Arctic Fox*, such as her snow-white tail and ears. Smaller details include a slight black tip on her tail, as well as small black spots on her left ear. She has *heterochromia*, as her left eye is a **darker blue** while her right eye is a **faint blue**.

Snow bears a **Kitsune Mask**, which she began personalizing by adding black spots to the left ear, mirroring the black spots on her actual ears, and integrating various pastel colours to *"add colour to the empty space of heaven"*, as she prefers to call it. However, after several of weeks of training with Vászi, and after her **EXPOSURE**, she no longer needed her Mask for the majority of cases, and keeps it as a remembrance piece to her **REBIRTH**.

Her name is directly derived from the area in which she died in her previous life, **Keustellet**, which is a city located in the northeast of **Álusken**, close to the *Vaon Mountain Range*, which is frequently covered in thick blankets of snow.

### Past Life
Before her Rebirth, Snow originally was a young man who studied Arts & Crafts, which further explains her continuous struggle to adapt to her new form and new life within the Temple and within the protection of Vászi. Besides this, not much is known about Snow's past life either, except for her previous identity and her cause of death, but what especially sparked Vászi's and Marten's interest is how vastly different her spirit was compared to her physical body. Because of this, Snow and Marten frequently spend time together ever since Snow's Exposure, to go over this and help Snow get more accustomed to her new life.

## // Winter 
Rough visual reference: **Pramanix** and **Ceobe** from **Arknights**.

**Winter** is a fairly young girl, with the animal traits of a *Snow Leopard*, and is frequently seen wearing thicker types of clothing, traditionally suited for winter weather, contra *Snow*, who is also a "Ghost of Winter" in a sense, but instead wears more thin dresses. 

Having mentioned Snow, she and Winter get along exceptionally well, and are sometimes even passed along as twins, despite Winter originally coming from Karlsborg whereas Snow lived in Keustellet before both of their respective *Last Lights*. Winter was led through *Rebirth* by **Temple Guardian Marten**, which is why she was immediately introduced to **Snow**, and why the three get along together well now. Originally having refuged in their home, they now simply live together as a family.

Winter bears **no mask**, and when offered one by **Sóvis**, kindly denied the offer to obtain a mask as well. Since she has adapted to the mountain ranges in both her past and present life, her breathing already adapted well enough to not need to use a mask for balance at all.

### Past Life
Before her Rebirth, Winter spent a lot of time roaming through the woods and went thrillseeking with a tight group of friends. She picked up things such as biology and photography as her fields of interest, and planned to study the differences in nature between Luniks and Earth, and hoped to help with reforesting on Earth too. Despite those dreams now lost forever after losing her life in the Morrésik Mountains, she is still often present in the forests and mountains near the **Vászi** and **Vao**, eager to learn more with unlimited time on her hands.

## // Spark
Rough visual reference: **Sparkle** from **Honkai: Star Rail**.

When your mind betrays you, and traumas haunt you throughout the day and night, what value is there in being reborn? For Spark, it was a tough question to answer, but as time went by, she gradually learned to adapt. Recovering from a **Premature Rebirth**, initiated by **Sóvis** just too soon after her death, she now has Winter by her side to help her heal and adapt to the new world she finds herself in.

### Past Life
Before her Rebirth, Spark aspired to become a professional musician and master the different forms of string music. Having studied together with the same teacher for many years, she mastered the guitar and violin, and when she felt like the had hit a wall, a sudden invite from the National Vaon Orchestra sparked her hope and willpower like it had never left. After the meeting at the studio, she dreamed to trial with the rest of the orchestra and learn the essence of the bass and cello too, but fell short of her dreams when her father betrayed and murdered her, along with the rest of her family members. Even with the dreams of playing in the orchestra, and haunted by the vivid memories of her death, her goal never left her side, and with unlimited time on her hands, she was eager to learn and master every string instrument there was to master in her next life.
