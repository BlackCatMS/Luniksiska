# TRAVEL RISK - Story
After the **June 2024** project reorganisation, the **TRAVEL RISK** story has been repurposed into becoming **ACT I** of the bigger story as a whole. This document will now serve as the story from **Nils**'s perspective, from the Prologue until Chapter Seven.
## Synopsis
After the nation of **United Máneá** collapsed in **2039**, it never managed to find the charm nor strength to rebuild itself to what it once was. Eternal conflict sparked before the fateful day in **2039**, and ever since, the conflict remained in the two remaining nations. With a lack of government control, drug dealing became the norm, and a middleman was an easy job to pick up. Without an involvement in drugs directly, one could still have an income to survive the next day. **Nils Lorieux** embarks on this dangerous journey, but after being caught on his very first mission, things don't turn out to be as easy as bringing a briefcase from point A to point B.

## PROLOGUE
### Rules remain rules
In the dark corners of Álef, hidden and tucked away in the alleyways in the central area, a group of people in black attire looked up as their silence was broken by footsteps. Approaching them was another black-dressed person, wearing a grey beanie as a cover for the rain. In his hand was a suitcase, seemingly full of money or full of goods. With his heart in his throat, he checks the time on his watch. **22.54**, he was 4 minutes late. One of the figures awaiting him at the end of the alleyway took notice of this, already drawing his pistol, and firing a shot that grazed his ear. Standing dead still in his tracks, he breathed deeply, fear rushing through his veins. **"Let this be your last warning, Niko, the next one is between your eyes."** He says with a booming voice, but quiet enough to not alert anyone else eavesdropping behind the alley. Noting down the time of arrival on his notepad, he opens his hand, waiting for the suitcase to be handed over, which Niko promptly does. *"Apologies, Kasper.. for the delay.."* he mutters, out of breath and full of fear, *"Traffic.. bit my ass.."* \
Shaking his head, the figure before him passes the suitcase onto the other two men in the alley, signalling them to check the contents and whether they align with the order or not, as he sets his focus back to Niko, clearly pissed off. **"Same shit as last time, Niko. One minute early is acceptable. One minute late is not."** 

With a quiet signal, the two figures checking the suitcase get the attention of Kasper, who immediately breaks eye contact with Niko and checks in on what they have to say. With a head full of fear and nerves on edge, he closes his eyes, as Kasper immediately draws his gun, aiming at Niko's head, his eyes full of both disappointment and rage. **"You're going to tell me what happened to two bags of Lucky Water, Niko, or this barrel will be the last fucking thing you're seeing in your life."** He quietly yells, making sure to watch his volume. Without hesitation, Niko drops one bag on the floor, his left hand remaining tightly in his pocket, clutching onto something. Breathing deeply, barely keeping to his senses, he feels a bullet penetrate his right shoulder, smoke coming out of the silenced barrel of the pistol that Kasper was holding. **"One last fucking chance, Niko, the next one is fatal. Rules remain rules, you know this."**

Taking another deep breath, Niko takes his hand out of his left pocket, revealing a used bag of Lucky Water, as well as an MPC5, which he immediately fired. Hitting Kasper's left leg and striking one of the two figures in the back of the alley with the suitcase, he sprints away, running for his life, or whatever would be left of that now. **"Fucking.. bastard..!"** Kasper grunts in pain, his hand clutching his thigh where the bullet hit him, while he feels his vision get foggy, struggling to keep his pistol raised and aimed. Firing uncontrollably, he grazes Niko's right arm and chest, injuring him further, before ultimately shooting him in the back, as he collapses, gasping for air. *"K, we need to leave from here."* One of the figures quietly whispers to Kasper, while the other figure makes his way to the collapsed body of Niko. **"Yeah yeah man, I know. Get me a shot of green and contact Mitch."** 

Sirens begin to echo through the walls of the city while the three mysterious men made their way out. Niko was left abandoned, having sent a distress signal before being shot, but ultimately, it was too late to rescue him. With a grunt of pain, Kasper takes the bullet out of his leg, dropping it on the table in the van as another person treats the wound. With the suitcase to his right, he sighs deeply, the green syringe shot kicking in and numbing his senses, numbing the pain. **"Every.. fucking day..!"** He grunts loudly, tightly gripping the suitcase's handle in anger. 

Driving off into the horizon, they make their way to Ákros, ready to face Mitch to report another troublesome handover.

## ONE - TRAVEL RISK
### Synopsis
*// A synopsis is due.*
### To the bottom
*"Antoine, you've got to be kidding me."*

With a quiet rustle through the wind, the subtle footsteps of two young men echo through the alleys of Deth-Kelétam. The city reeked with bad smells, flooded sewage systems that have been neglected since the fall of United Máneá, which had put not only the city in despair, but the rest of the remaining nation as well. **"Sorry, I kept you waiting long enough, Nils"** Antoine said quietly to him, turning his head around to face him while his hand rested on a doorknob that led to an otherwise suspiciously unmarked building. **"We're here, keep quiet."** 

The door closes behind the two, and Nils takes a deep breath of fresh air now that he was finally sealed off the terrible air that lingered outside. **"Follow me, it's downstairs"** Antoine whispered, revealing a poorly lit stone staircase that lead down to what felt like the bottom of the planet. *"Are you sure we're at the right place? This seems abandoned."* Nils whispered back, doubts beginning to form in his mind about whether this was really the right choice for them to make. Quietly, Antoine began to make his way down the stairwell, the lights getting more dim the further he went down as Nils hesitantly followed after him, his heart beating loudly in his chest. It felt like an eternity, but the two finally reached the bottom of the stairwell, and after putting his finger against his lips, Antoine looked back at Nils before reopening yet another door. 

This door led them into a slightly more lively room, or so Nils wanted to believe. The lighting inside was fairly dim, but he could at the very least see much better what was inside the room. A large desk, and a pair of seats in front of it. There were plenty of small trees and plants that decorated the desk and walls, giving it an eerie, natural-yet-unnatural feeling, sending a shiver down Nils's spine. The door closed behind the two young men, and like clockwork, the enormous office chair on the opposite end of the desk spun around, revealing an older man wearing sunglasses. Another chill went through Nils's body, the atmosphere in the room beginning to properly creep him out. With a wide smile on his face, he opened his arms wide, directing the two men to sit down on the chairs adjacent to his own. **"Take a seat."** He grinned, and even though his eyes were hidden behind his sunglasses, Nils could feel his gaze burn into his own eyes. **"Let's talk business."**
### To the point
**"I take it your friend has given you a rundown of what to expect?"** The man asked Nils with a burning stare into his eyes, holding his hands together by pressing his fingertips against each other. Antoine nodded, and followed the gaze of the man to stare at Nils too, who felt like sweat was dripping down his head now that two pairs of eyes were looking at him. *"I believe so."* Nils began, struggling to formulate a proper reply. *"A netrunning job, wasn't it? Point A.. to point B."* \
The man grinned, adding an icy chill to the already frozen cold atmosphere inside the room. **"You've got the basics right."** He smiled, before moving his hands away from each other, and offering his right hand to Nils, hoping to receive a handshake to establish an agreement so soon after meeting. **"I am Mitch O'Well. You won't see my face often, but you will hear the name "Dáritke" more often from now on. That will be who you will be working for."** He began. Shaking his hand, Nils felt the slightest hint of sincerity, and almost immediately afterwards he could feel the room begin to warm up. Even if the sheer iciness had gone away, it still felt incredibly cold within the room, but the handshake and agreement gave him the slightest amount of comfort and safety. 

**"I hope your friend, Antoine, is also aware of the regions the two of you will travel through, however."** Mitch continued, having let go of Nils's hand. The icy chill immediately returned, sending another shiver down his spine. *"Antoine didn't mention anything about regions!"* His mind yelled at him, stirring up to the confusion as doubts were now beginning to build up on top of the eerie atmosphere. But keeping himself composed and calm, he eagerly listened to what Mitch had to say, doing his best to not come across as afraid. He already knew that the work he was going to do would be risky, and would be the only means of income to keep his shelter, but the pay was high. Even with such a risky job, he could save up once more, and even pay his parents a visit in France. Even with such risks, so would come rewards. \
**"I believe you've already noticed the smell that looms in this city."** Mitch continued, leaning back in his chair, confident that the two eager young men wouldn't run away from him now. **"You two have found yourselves in an area marked as a "Travel Risk". It's why you don't see any foreigners here, and it's been this way for the past decades. That smell is the remains of a series of drugs that were disposed of incorrectly. I take it you've already had your hands on some of them?"** \
Antoine nodded, admitting that he had taken a peek at a trade he had completed a few weeks ago. Back then he wasn't working for Dáritke just yet, but he did complete the trade in Deth-Kelétam, the same city they found themselves in now. Nils felt his heart beating in his throat, realising that he could've very well been doing drug dealing all this time, without being fully aware of it. All the packages he'd carried over, how many of them had ended up in the slums and streets? \
Mitch's grin remained in place, and Nils could feel his eyes looking back and forth at their faces, his gaze as sharp as the very first second the two had met. In a swift motion, he revealed two papers from underneath the desk, with a pen clipped onto the paper at the very top. **"If I haven't been clear, please let me know. But this paper should explain enough."** He smirked, placing his fingertips together once more as he watched the two young men read carefully through what appeared to be contracts. In just a matter of moments, Nils's focus was broken by the sound of a pen's writing on paper, and glancing to his right, he could see that Antoine had signed the contract. His own nerves were now beginning to eat his senses at the back of his mind, and worries began to build up. *"Was it really the right decision?"* He asked himself, and reading through the contract from top to bottom once more, one line stood out. **"The recipient of this contract can not break ties with the employer (Dáritke) under any circumstances."** Nils gulped, and taking a deep breath, he envisioned himself in France, meeting his parents again after what would have been many years by then. It was an enormous risk he would take, but one that came with an enormous reward. 

Exhaling deeply, Nils unclipped the pen from the paper, and let the ink of the pen flow to write his signature at the bottom of the page. The contract was signed. 
 
## TWO - Into the Unknown 
### Synopsis
Nils Lorieux enters his first mission within the company that Antoine had recommended him. He is set to deliver a bag that is packed to the brim with Lucky Water, amongst other various yet-unspecified drugs. However, he wasn't told about the contents of the bag, and believes he's carrying various forms of equipment for a company called **"Vátnelári"**. Before delivery, he is caught on the way there by two mysterious men dressed in black and is instead brought to **"The Agency"**.
### Into the unknown
**"I know it's tempting to look inside, but do not. Every delivery man wonders what its recipients ordered, but that's not for them to know."**

Nils nodded slowly after the waiter had finished explaining his scheduled trip once more. Taking the bag off the counter, he was perplexed at the weight of the bag. *"Just how much did they stuff in this..?"* He thought to himself, wrapping the straps around his shoulder before waving goodbye to the waiter that had given him the bag. It was a relatively inconspicuous bag, having no markings nor brandings in any form or shape. The only feature it had, was an immense weight and a shoulder strap. But sighing deeply after going through the revolving door, he gradually made his way towards the nearest metro station. \
Nils sighed deeply once more as he made his way past the seemingly abandoned streets of Deth-Kelétam. The rain wasn't helping the dismal appearance of the streets at all, and the weight of the bag on his shoulder was already giving him doubts about the mission he had taken up. The situation in Máneá was extremely grim, and stepping through the puddles on the worn-down tiles beneath him, he began daydreaming of the life his parents were now living back in France. He'd never been to Earth himself, and looking up to the sky, he knew that every single spare cent that he had earned over the past years had gone straight to his parents. He'd stay behind himself and make a living one way or another, but the weight on his shoulders, the strap of the bag digging into his skin had become the embodiment of that weight. He turned the corner, remembering Antoine's suggestion to look for a different field of work, and an opportunity to earn even more money. but the business would be shadier, and the risks would increase. But taking a deep breath, Nils looked back before him, following the signs that led him towards the central metro station, and before long, his mission would continue.

His journey would start at platform 4, boarding the rapid transit metro that would bring him directly to Álef without any stops along the way. The metro system was completely automated, and had been that way almost immediately after humanity first made their way to Lúniks. The automated metro was once the most recognisable aspect of United Máneá, but after the collapse of the nation, it was soon forgotten. But even three decades after the fact, the metro, although in a much poorer condition, still worked like a charm. And upon arrival, Nils made his way through the doors and sat himself down on a vacant seat, exhaling deeply now that he could finally let the weight of the bag off his shoulders. The metro almost immediately departed for Álef, and getting pushed back in his seat slightly, he continued to stare at the bag that was now at his feet. Exhaling deeply, he decided against taking a peek inside, and instead took out his phone to check once more that his scheduled route would be. *"Transfer in Álef Centrale.. Line S14 to Lóivitlán.. Krónaplaca.."* He mumbled to himself, having buried himself in his phone so deeply already that he didn't realise the metro had already made its way out of the tunnels, going overground and letting natural light flood the carriages. Putting his phone back down, Nils glanced out of the window, a troubled yet warm smile appearing on his face as he stared into the distance. *"The hills look great.."* He whispered to himself, admiring the view of the grassy hills outside of the large window, knowing that it was a few he'd expect to see many more times in the future. The troubled smile faded the longer he stared at the grassy field, leaving only a warm, relaxed smile on his face as his vision began to blur. Álef was still a while away, and by the time the train would approach it, it would already go back into the underground tunnel systems. Nils exhaled deeply, slowly closing his eyes, dozing off momentarily with the gentle sound of the tracks echoing through the carriages relaxing and soothing him as the metro speeded to Álef.

Suddenly snapping back to his senses, Nils reopens his eyes to see the artificial lighting in the metro having returned, exchanging the bright sunlight from just a few moments ago. Burying his face in his hands and rubbing his eyes after waking up from a short nap, he realised the metro was gradually beginning to slow down. *"Nest halt: Álef Centrale. Di sette stace, sette metro terminést."* The metro chimed, and standing up from his seat, Nils picked up the heavy bag and swung it around his shoulder once more, having forgotten its weight already, and upon arriving at the Álef Central station, he made his way to his transfer at platform 3. Like clockwork, Line S14 arrived perfectly on time, and before long, Nils had found himself another seat and began dozing off yet again, letting the metro carry him towards his next stop once more.

The metro chimed once more. *"Nest halt: Krónapláca."* Nils's destination was arriving. Double checking the note that the waiter had given him, he stood back up and slung the bag back around his shoulder and pressed the button marked "STOP" on the support beam next to him. Nils sighed deeply, staring at the trail of lights in the tunnel approaching the platform of the metro station where he was set to get out at. He could see plenty of people waiting for the metro to stop to board, taking Nils's seat and going forward to their own destinations, but standing in front of the doors, he saw two men dressed in pitch-black attire, seemingly waiting for him to get out. Doubts and worries were beginning to swirl around in his mind. The waiter hadn't said anything about being awaited at Krónapláca, he'd have to walk his way towards the Sk. Garist tower himself, and yet it seemed like the mission had changed at the very last moment, unbeknownst to him. \
Nils stepped out of the metro, his heart beating loudly in his chest. \
**"Afternoon, Nils."** The man on the left said to him. Both of them were wearing shades, hiding their expression from Nils. **"Follow us."** \
Nils breathed heavily, and in an unstable manner. Frantically looking around for other clues for his mission, he couldn't find any, and with a worried tone in his voice, he opened his mouth to ask one question, all sorts of scenarios now racing through his head. *"Are you from.. Vátnelári?"* \
The man shook his head, pushing Nils forward ever so slight to get him to follow the two of them. 

**"Not quite. We'll explain later."**

## THREE - Youngblood
### Youngblood 
With a slam on the table, the bag of goods is presented, with the two black-dressed mysterious men escorting Nils to the lounge chair. *"W-What does any of this mean?"* he asks in distress, his heart rate having risen in the past minutes on the way to the strange, hidden room he now finds himself in. Compared to the meeting with Mitch he had with Antoine for Dáritke, this room seemed much more lively and well maintained, and strangely enough, he felt welcome here. Rather than stepping into a cold, icy room, the atmosphere felt oddly warm and inviting. After a few seconds, the chair on the other end of the desk turns around, revealing another mysterious figure. A woman with long, slightly wavy hair, with a mixture of blue streaks in her hair that matched her similarly coloured suit. She appeared straightforward, she was here for business, not for chitchat.

**"Is this the middleman?"** She asked in a noticeably annoyed tone, sending further shivers down Nils's spine. Looking across his shoulders, he could see the two men nod slowly and quietly, before his eyes drew back to the woman before him. Her tone quickly changed, the expression on her face turning into a smirk, like a predator eyeing their prey. **"I haven't seen your face before, you're young blood. Tell me, what's your name?"** She said with a grin on her face, a sly tone in her voice, riling up more fear in Nils's body and mind. Nodding slowly, he whispers back, deciding to go with the strange, and eerie flow of the wave he found himself on. *"Nils.."* He began, his face turning pale after seeing the woman before him stand up to inspect the bag. *"Nils Lorieux.."*

With a quiet chuckle, the mysterious woman continued to play with Nils's feelings as she further inspected the bag, getting a feel of the contents and almost checking it for hidden hardware. After a few moments, she unzipped the main compartment, and retrieved a cigarette box from the end of the table, taking a cigarette and lighting it in one quick motion. Taking two puffs, she smiled warmly, eyeing the contents of the bag. From the lounge chair that Nils found himself in, he could recognise various tightly-wrapped packages, all colour-coded differently. He kept his hands by his side, the burning gaze of the two men supervising not only him, but also the woman on the opposite hand going through the bag he had brought across the border. But after what felt like an eternity, Nils's furiously beating heart was given the opportunity to calm down as the woman took the cigarette back from her lips, placing it on the ashtray to her left as she lowered her shades, gazing at Nils, before her smirk turned into a wide smile. **"They gave you a handful on your first trade."** She laughed, stretching out her hand across the table, offering a friendly handshake to him. Hesitantly, Nils stood up from his chair and shook her hand. **"The name's Raléi, we should take in a more.. private area."** She smiled with a gentle tone, her blue eyes sparkling as she gazed at the two men standing behind Nils. Almost immediately, the two nod and bow, and promptly make their way to exit the room, as the two new acquaintances return to their seats.

Upon the quiet sound of the door closing and locking behind the two men that had left the room, Raléi immediately presents a firearm, placing it on the table with her index finger resting firmly across the barrel of the pistol. Her smile on her face remained, assuring Nils to not be afraid. With a quiet sigh, she took off her hat and sunglasses and placed them at the rightmost end of the table, before breaking the silence in a more quiet and calm tone. **"Do you have any idea what it is that you brought me today?"** She asked with a worried tone. Nils gulped, struggling to find an answer to a question he wasn't expecting to receive at all. Clenching his fists, he glances around the room quickly, looking for any potential intruder that might be eavesdropping on them, but returning his eyes to Raléi, he exhales deeply. *"No.. Raléi. I don't know what I carried."* \
**I suspected as much.** She immediately replied, sighing deeply but quietly as she takes a yellow package from the bag, slowly taking off the wrap to reveal a white styrofoam box. With a quick glance at Nils's increasingly worried expression on his face, she smiles warmly at him. **"Don't worry, this isn't harmful. This city is littered with this anyway."** She said calmly, taking a syringe and a little canister with an opaque fluid inside, which she placed on the table before her. **"This is a drug called "Lucky Water". It's a drug that you inject to trick your brain into producing excess dopamine and stress-relieving hormones for an extra kick, similarly to anti-depressants with an upbeat flavour. You're not the first to carry this, and you surely won't be the last, but you can imagine why it's so popular here in Zakh'háfo."** She explained, standing up and lifting the bag off the table, placing it beside her chair before returning her gaze to Nils.

Struggling to find the words to reply, he decides to remain silent for now, having no idea on how to even begin formulating a reply. The doubts that had been stirring inside his head had turned out to be true. The immense income that would come with middleman trading that Antoine had recommended him was obviously a façade to incredibly shady businesses. Drug dealing had been on his mind, and he had carried and transported weed before, but he had vowed to never set foot deeper into such shady businesses. And yet, here he was, having delivered that what he promised to never deliver. Even for Antoine, this was outrageous. A feeling of betrayal whirled up inside him. The person he had trusted for so long, the person that had given him a hand through his income over the past years, who had helped him fund the home for his parents in France, had he known all along? \
With the snap of Raléi's fingers, Nils was brought back to his senses as he saw her hand right before his eyes. She could see the worries in his eyes ever brightly and clearly, and picking up the pistol that she had placed on the table, she ejected the magazine, before placing both back on the table and reassuring Nils once more, hoping to ease his worries and stress. **"When I say that I mean no harm, Nils, it's a promise. Your friend has obviously lured you into this circuit."** She calmly explained, revealing a display from the underside of the table and opening a form, she continued to explain as she gave the display to Nils to read. **"Whoever your friend is, they have introduced you to "Dáritke". They pretend to be a middleman company that handles trades of important materials or documents between companies."** She continued, her expression having turned into a more stern one after mentioning the name "Dáritke". Watching Nils read through the page that she had given him, she sighed deeply. **"Half of that is true. You're indeed a middleman that was sent on a delivery between two companies. But Dáritke isn't a company, and neither are we, and you didn't carry "important materials" either."** \
Nils shivered, his eyes veered to the pistol that was just a little to the left of him. In his mind, he could see the entire journey that he had been sent on replay in his head once more. From signing the contract and shaking hands with Mitch, to receiving the heavy bag from the waiter, to being given access to a transport card that ultimately had brought him to the very room he found himself in right now. He should've seen this entire situation coming from the very second he followed Antoine down that stairwell in Deth-Kelétam. A shady business, a shady mission, and yet he pulled through just so he would be able to live a little on the easier side of things. He felt his throat clog up, and placing his hand on his mouth, he decided to keep quiet for the time being, letting his mind clear up a little bit more. 

**"I'll keep things simple."** Raléi began, taking a hold of the display and changing the page to another contract, returning it to Nils to read through properly once his mind cleared up a little. **"Dáritke will know that you will remain in Álef, of course. You were set to bring back another bag from the your original destination, right?"** Nils nodded slowly, beginning to read through the contract before him. Raléi sighed deeply before continuing. **"For your own safety, you're not setting another step in Deth-Kelétam. That means never seeing your "friend" again. They'll probably declare you KIA, and that'll be the end of your short journey at Dáritke."** \
Nils continued to read through the contract, and reaching the bottom of the page, he began to recognise various named that he had also read in the various forms and papers he had received from Dáritke. But one portion intrigued him. He would receive shelter in Kristánisin, and he would receive a new, safe function. Without too much thought, all that was on his mind was his own safety, and he immediately signed the contract at the very bottom of the page. Exhaling deeply, Nils looked back up from the display to see Raléi reveal another unloaded pistol. *"What happens now?"* He quietly asked, receiving mixed signals from Raléi as she slid the pistol over the table towards him, followed by a stretch hand. 

**"This becomes yours."** She replied with a wide smile, shaking Nils's hand. **"Let's get you settled in. Welcome to The Agency."**

## FOUR - New Faces, Same Antics
### Synopsis
Nils is acquired by **The Agency**, and burns his bridges with **Dáritke**. Together with Raléi, he now begins protocol training and grows into his new role as management and netrunning. Meeting Omáti, the two get along very well and commence training together. This chapter will mostly encompass said training and introduce a bit of dialogue and showcase the personalities of the various characters.
### Drafted layout
*// Nils is introduced to the rest of the existing team within the Agency by Raléi, and learns that the team is rather small. He gets introduced to Omáti, a seasoned veteran with many years or military combat under his belt, who has retired from the Zakh'háfon military to aid others where possible. Together, the three go through the arsenal, and Nils is introduced to the basic procedures that The Agency undertakes during an interception mission. (Hint to REFRESH?)*

## FIVE - Where we left off
### Synopsis
*// This synopsis is subject to change, as it no longer matches the current layout of ACT I* \
Extracts [[LUCKY WATER#Drafted Story the uuuhh]]. \
Getting along well with Omáti, the two go onto their first mission together in **Stéu-Khessi**\* (*// instead of Deth-Kelétam*), with the goal to complete a Lucky Water trade with a representative from **Vátnelári**\* (*// Potentially changing to Dáritke*). 

### Drafted Layout
*// Nils and Omáti travel to **Stéu-Khessi** together, and similarly to when Nils was interrupted during his mission, they interrupt another clueless middleman. Coincidentally, they meet another young person who was undergoing a similar mission that Nils was on before being intercepted by the two Agency guards. Halting the young person, Omáti explains the truth behind Dáritke to them, but they refuse to accept the invitation to instead burn bridged and join The Agency.*

## SIX - Familiar Foe 
### Synopsis
*// This synopsis is outdated and subject to change.* \
In his next mission, **Nils** is sent to receive a handover from **Dáritke** under supervision of Raléi and a representative from Dáritke. To Nils's surprise, the handover from Dáritke is brought out by Kasper and Antoine, which creates a troublesome situation. Especially now that Nils learned that Dáritke isn't the best agency to work under, with its agents being frequently exploited, he also came to learn that Antoine wasn't the best person in the world as a result, and their friendship and partnership was merely a fluke. Despite this, all ends well, and both parties decide to keep their mouth shut regarding this new information. Kasper too, keeps his mouth shut about Nils's defection to **The Agency**, which means **Mitch** does not learn about this, leading up to **RUDE REUNION**.
### Drafted Layout
*// Following a hint received from the intercepted middleman, Nils and Raléi find a trail and make their way to a location where **Kasper**, a manager under **Mitch**, is expected to complete a trade with a Vátnelári representative. However, Nils recognises a familiar person standing next to Kasper. It was nobody other than his old friend **Antoine**.*


## SEVEN - RUDE REUNION
### Synopsis
In a strange letter, Nils and Raléi receive an invite to an otherwise inconspicuous ball in **Kristensend, Rhódisz**. Present are top figures from the various companies that fled to Rhódisz after the Collapse of United Máneá, and with various agencies having sprung up in the two other nations, the ball was seen as a means of shaking hands, and seeing what is possible in terms of reaching an agreement together, in hopes to help the economic and societal damage that was done. 

Both **Dáritke** and **Vátnelári** representatives were present, next to Nils and Raléi, which sparked uncertainties for all parties that were present. After what feels like a peaceful hour of chitchat with various companies (Notably *Ódóni*/*Hammerhead*), a discourse is finally sparked as **Mitch O'Well** approaches Raléi, and takes notice of Nils, who was once part of **Dáritke**. Drama and conflict ensues, and Raléi's stealth weaponry is unveiled to Mitch, with a subtle hint to "Keep this out of the public" and "Handle things in a more private manner". Mitch ignores this hint, and a combat situation ensues.


### RUDE REUNION
*"Aye, Nils! That you?"* An older, raspy voice said from afar. Raléi shook hands with Thomas, bidding them farewell for now, while Nils turned around to the ever familiar voice that could only belong to one person: Dáritke's Mitch O'Well. *"Been a while, eh? Presumed you were dead. Package delivered, killed on site. Take it you've met my old friend instead?"* He spoke, pointing at Raléi, who had taken notice of the sudden rival's arrival. **"Been a while, Mitch"** Raléi replied, interrupting Nils before he could even formulate a response for himself. **"Looking terrible as ever. Not a single change in those ten years."** She said with a stern look. Now standing in the middle of the two, Nils quickly figured out what situation he found himself in, and made his way back to stand besides Raléi. *Must be bad blood..* He thought to himself, as Mitch continued to formulate his words, clearly struggling. *Is he under the influence?*  \
*"I take you've given my boy a roof of his own."* He began, his finger pointing and shaking at Nils's face. *"Bothers me. Antoine promised me goods, and now my good is elsewhere.. I'm not too stoked about knowing this boy is sharing Dáritke's secrets with you, miss Alenti..!"* \
His shaky hand moved to his hip, as he slowly moved his blazer to the side, revealing a holster and a pistol. It seemed that, despite being in a terrible shape, Mitch didn't care about his health. Just like Nils had learned from Antoine and Kasper, he was a straightforward man. Straight to business, no chitchat. And it seemed the chitchat was over. \
Raléi immediately stepped forward, carefully but forcefully grabbing Mitch by his blazer, hissing into his ear. **"We're not doing this in Kristensend, Mitch."** In a hurry, Nils took a hold of his own pistol on his hip, having raised alert while Raléi continued to try and play down Mitch. He could see the blue glow begin to shine more prominent through her own suit, and her left hand glove was gone, indicating that she was ready to use her stealth blade at any point. *Her neurotech is already activating. This is bad.*  
  
A gunshot echoes through the hall, and panic ensues while the people steer away from the trio. Still holding him firmly by his blazer, Raléi continues to try and tone down Mitch, doing her best to not escalate this any further than it can. A shot was already fired, the attention was already drawn to them, what more could go wrong? **"I'd warned you, Mitch. Now everyone frowns upon Dáritke. How's Gustavo going to think about this action? You disturbed the Kristensend Ball?"** She said, making sure to mock him in front of all the eyes that were now fixated onto them. With a swift move, she pushes him to the floor. Frantically, Mitch tries to grab his pistol, only finding that the holster was empty and that his own pistol was being aimed between his eyes. Time seemed to pass in slow-motion, but quickly continued as the magazine dropped to the floor. **"Looks are deceiving, Mitch.** Raléi said, emptying the pistol of its last bullet and tossing it to the side with the safety on. **"You're not facing the same Raléi as five years ago. And yet I'm facing the exact same Mitch."** She smirked, continuously looking down onto the now-frightened and confused face of Mitch. He was clearly pushed into a corner he couldn't escape out of, his only option here was to admit defeat. But doing so wasn't part of his dictionary, as he struggled to stand up, fists raised, not wanting to give up this easily. With her own fists raised, Raléi scoffs at Mitch, laughing quietly under her own breath while Nils couldn't do anything other than watch the scene unfold. **"It's been a while, Mitch. Let's see if those fighting stances aged like wine, or like milk."**

Clumsily, Mitch lunged forward and tried to land a blow on Raléi's chest, but was taken aback by how quickly she was able to move and instead land a blow on his own jaw, disorienting him for just a moment as he struggles to stand steadily on his feet. **"What have you been up to these past ten years anyway, Mitch?"** She smirked, her eyes closely following every little movement and adjustment that Mitch made in an attempt to get his own stability back. **"Been playing commander? Sending Kasper on all the missions you needed to do yourself?"** \
Pissed off, Mitch lunges forward once more, trying to land a blow straight into Raléi's chest, but finding himself blocked once more as her reaction speed was simply out of this world.
