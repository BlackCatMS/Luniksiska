# NEUROKICK
## FOCUS TWO: NEUROKICK
**NEUROKICK** is an electronic injection-type drug that greatly exaggerates the visual feedback the brain can produce. This additionally forces the user to enter a REM sleep, where the rest of the drug continues its effect during the forced dream state. \
**NEUROKICK** is a *2030 greenlit drug* that was originally used for science within the booming science area in *Amadnésam*, but ever since the **Collapse of United Máneá**, the technology used for the scientific research quickly ended up on the streets, and various clones appeared, all providing the same result in altered forms. 

## Functionality
### 2030 Greenlight program
In its original intended usage, the recipient of the drug will be placed on a bed conforming to *Máneán Hospital standards*, where two doctors will observe and monitor the effects and dosage of the drug. In test stages in **2028**, a chip would be implanted in the recipient's brain, just above their ear, but since **2030**, this location has been moved to the wrist to increase the safety of the recipient. \
The implanted chip is connected via a slim wire, which connects to the terminal that the dosage is loaded upon. Upon activation, the recipient may experience vibrant colours while their brain adjusts to the extreme load that is being put upon their senses, before being forced into a sleep where the rest of the dosage takes hold of their imagination and dreams. When the dosage runs out, the dreams reportedly become weirder and less logical as compared to during the dosage, until they exit the REM stage and enter a light sleep, which lasts about another one or two hours. \
Originally, this process was intended to research the various effects that electronic signals would have on the human brain during sleep, and whether or not these would enhance imagination where the regular "awake" state of the brain would be limited. This initially received backlash and was believed to "keep people working 24/7", but has since gained positive support when the first results rolled in. 

After the **Máneán collapse**, the institute that researched this technology escaped to Rhódisz and Kérisant, where they continue to evolve the technology in safe hands.

### Máneán collapse and street clones
After the collapse of **United Máneá** in *2039*, any sort of security was quickly lost and classified technology and research found the streets in no-time. This means that next to **NEUROKICK**, other means of research were soon found on the streets in dark alleyways, either sold for a high price, or faked and sold for a low one. Experimental weaponry, as well as body modifications using electronics and so-called cyberwear, quickly ended up in unauthorised areas with an intent of harm. 

A key change in the method is that the drug is now completely *standalone*, and no longer needs the external monitoring nor the external doctors or applicants that supply the drug. This makes the drug easier to apply by a single person. Additionally, the chip is not ejected after usage, and can be used *numerous times*, making it much more attractive for those that are looking for a frequent kick, rather than a dedicated research kick. 

The danger curve is straightforward: The higher the price, the higher quality the chip and controller you're getting, and as the price declines, the risk of getting a *fake* or *harmful* controller increase, which can give you an adverse effect and can stimulate your brain enough to enter a coma, which is something that more and more frequently happens as the economy continues to crumble.
