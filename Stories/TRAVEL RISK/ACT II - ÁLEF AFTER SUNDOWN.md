## Synopsis
The deals come out at night, hidden in the alleys of **Álef**. Its automated transport system makes frequent travel between trading hotspots a breeze, and **Maria** knows this by heart. In an attempted interception of a trade, she comes in contact with **Raléi**, from **The Agency**, and the two agree on a ceasefire for the time being, and to combine their strengths to figure out who is intercepting their respective trades. Despite not being part of an agency, **Maria** is especially skilled in close-quarters combat, and looks are especially deceiving with her build. 

## EIGHT - Álef After Sundown
### Confrontation, at ease
*"Why raise your weapon? You don't know me."*  
  
The woman quietly chuckled, showing no signs of fear despite facing down the barrel of a pistol. Her hair was short, but wavy, round glasses decorated her otherwise pale face, resting on her nose just above her freckles. She didn't appear like a person that excelled in a combat situation that she found herself in, but even so, her guard wouldn't go down.  
  
**"Don't play games, I've seen you intercept that briefcase."** The booming voice of the man replied, bouncing against the narrow walls in the alleyway they found themselves in. Looking down the short barrel of his pistol, the woman before him raised her arms, shrugging in response. *"I've no clue what you're on about."* She began, looking around her, below her, behind her. *"You clearly know what you're looking for, but I don't see it. Where's this briefcase you desperately want, then?"*  
  
Instead of a loud voice, the sound of a loud bang now passed through the alley, echoing and dissipating into the openness of the adjacent streets. But no sound follows, and the bang of the pistol fades away into the distance. The man's eyes opened widely, dumbfounded at the sight before him. Through the iron sights, he was aiming right at the forehead of the woman he was facing. But after firing, his pistol stayed in the same place, facing the exact same position, but she was now standing a metre to the left. In under a second, she must have moved, or he must have had a shiver go through his body to miss the shot.  
  
*"Tch. All of you are the same."* She scoffed, biting her nail, her expression having changed from being neutral to clearly being annoyed. The man with the pistol stayed frozen in place, struggling, no, completely unable to process the absurdity of what he just witnessed. He opens his mouth, trying to express his mind, but finds himself short on words. The briefcase he saw her running with just moments ago had vanished out of sight, and that is already disregarding the fact she managed to dodge a bullet, a bullet!  
  
*"I'll take my leave, if you have nothing to say."* She sighed. The man lowered his pistol in defeat, his finger leaving the trigger. **"H-How.. do you do.. such things?"** He stammered, his eyes following the figure of the woman that was walking past him, now having stopped beside him. She smirked, her crimson eyes gazing him directly into his soul as she formulated her reply with a smug expression on her face. *"You're slow, and you're predictable. Two steps separate us. You're one step behind, and I'm one ahead."* She laughed, breaking the staredown as she continued forward to walk out of the alley, into the open street.  
  
*"Do me a favour. Tell Mitch that Maria is in Álef. He'll be stoked to hear that."*

Still stunned, the guard looked behind him, only facing the back of the young woman turn around the corner. Deflated, and defeated, he sighs deeply, and finally walks forward out of the alleyway. 

### Confrontation, with difficulty
A weapon raised once more. A briefcase held tightly in the other hand. But this time around, it was Maria herself that was looking down the narrow and short barrel of a pistol. The neutral expression that was on her face while confronting the guard was prominent yet again, as she broke the awkward silence and addressed the person at the end of the barrel, her hands raised. *"Agency, isn't it? What brings you here to me?"* \
The woman before her barrel chuckled, raising her hands in the air to admit defeat already. Her blue, straight hair shined brightly in the sunlight. **"You're young. Do you know what you're doing?"** She asked with a gentle, and innocent smile. She meant no harm, that much was for sure, but Maria didn't take any further risks after already encountering troubles earlier. *"I might be. But I don't do second guessing. What brings you here to me?"* \
**"Curiosity."** The woman replied with a wider smile. **"You're skilled. I mean no harm, nor do I need the briefcase you're holding. Let's point the gun down and talk it out, shall we, Maria?"** \
Maria complied immediately upon hearing her own name, and returned the pistol into her pocket, sighing deeply. *"At least put on a bit more of a contest, Raléi."* She laughed, the tense atmosphere between the two dissipating within a second. She clutched the briefcase tightly in her left hand, stepping forward towards Raléi to offer a handshake. *"You're clever. Exactly like how I expected you to be. Care for a coffee?"*



## NINE - Challenging Fate
### Synopsis
**Raléi** and **Maria** teamed up together, and Maria's knowledge of the security systems and schedules of the Álef Metro gave the newly formed duo the upper hand in reaching and infiltrating a Dáritke stronghold. Even though Gustavo had died ten years ago, the legacy he left behind remained in the mysterious, grim agency, and it grew more and more akin to a mafia day by day. Raléi and Maria agree on the spot to take down Dáritke as a whole together, and with weapons loaded, they breach through the stronghold to make a stand.
## TEN - By a Hair's Width
### Synopsis
Taking down an incredibly well-organised agency is much easier said than done, and Raléi and Maria narrowly escape from the freshly-infiltrated stronghold in Álef, leaving a target on the both of their heads for the rest of their lives.
## ELEVEN - What Hides Under Álef
### Synopsis
**The Agency** is now a target to **Dáritke**, and the patriotic members of the latter do not mess around with assigned targets. The bounty hunt on Raléi and Maria continues, which forces the two to dwell around through the packed metro system of Álef, in hopes to stay out of sight, and in hopes to arm themselves for when the inevitable strikes.
## TWELVE - TARGETING // TARGETED
### Synopsis
**Maria**'s knowledge of the ins and outs of the Álef Metro shine brightly, and with a stroke of luck, the two manage to intercept various Dáritke mercenaries and stock up. With restocked arms and confidence, the two begin their second attempt at infiltrating and bringing down Dáritke with a new approach: Targeting those, that are targeting them.
## THIRTEEN - AT ONE'S WITS' END // ONE LAST STAND
### Synopsis
Maria's strength begins to dwindle after being exposed to the continuous stress that comes with taking the lives of others, and her genius begins to fail her. Combined with Raléi's wounds beginning to wear her down, the two reach what feels like a dead end once more. The two make their way to the metro station of Álef-Nórem, which Maria remembered to have plenty of hallways and alleys to hide in and navigate through, but Dáritke finally found themselves one step ahead, and had armed the entire station with explosives, also eager to end the lives of the two women now that they were boxed in without an exit. Raléi's wounds have slowed her down too much, and before the two realised they had walked right into Dáritke's trap, the fuse had already been lit and the metro station initiated the self-destruction sequence. The crunching of steel beams collapsing from above echoes through the tunnels, and despite her best effort, Maria can't manage to save Raléi from the imminent debris, and is forced to watch her disappear behind the smoke, dust, and steel.
## EPILOGUE - Álef At Dawn
### Synopsis
The Agency doesn't last another day after the gruesome incident in Álef. Raléi's seat is left vacant, with no successor that was willing to take her place, and immediately receive a target on their heads. Maria remains outside Álef-Nórem for the remainder of the day, watching the sunrise with the collapsed metro station behind her, where her colleague, her close friend, had lost her life note even a day ago. The hope the two shared to restore Máneá and Zakh'háfo to peaceful nations was dwindling, and the dream seemed impossible to reach.
