*// The below snippet is the original drafted synopsis for this story. However, the actually drafted story does not yet match. The synopsis is subject to change.*

*// This story is currently being developed into **ACT II** of the bigger **Travel Risk** story. This means the outline is subject to change.*

## Synopsis
The deals come out at night, hidden in the alleys of **Álef**. Its automated transport system makes frequent travel between trading hotspots a breeze, and **Maria** knows this by heart. In an attempted interception of a trade, she comes in contact with **Raléi**, from **The Agency**, and the two agree on a ceasefire for the time being, and to combine their strengths to figure out who is intercepting their respective trades. Despite not being part of an agency, **Maria** is especially skilled in close-quarters combat, and looks are especially deceiving with her build. 

## EIGHT - Álef After Sundown
### Confrontation, with ease
*"Why raise your weapon? You don't know me."*  
  
The woman quietly laughed, showing no signs of fear despite being on the receiving end of the barrel of a pistol. Her hair was short, but wavy, round glasses decorated her otherwise pale face, resting on her nose just above her freckles. She didn't appear like a person that excelled in a combat situation that she found herself in, but even so, her guard wouldn't go down.  
  
**"Don't play games, I've seen you intercept that briefcase."** The booming voice of the man replied, bouncing against the narrow walls in the alleyway they found themselves in. Looking down the short barrel of his pistol, the woman before him raised her arms, shrugging in response. *"I've no clue what you're on about."* She began, looking around her, below her, behind her. *"You clearly know what you're looking for, but I don't see it. Where's this briefcase you desperately want, then?"*  
  
Instead of a loud voice, the sound of a loud bang now passed through the alley, echoing and dissipating into the openness of the adjacent streets. But no sound follows, and the bang of the pistol fades away into the distance. The man's eyes opened widely, dumbfounded at the sight before him. Through the iron sights, he was aiming right at the forehead of the woman he was facing. But after firing, his pistol stayed in the same place, facing the exact same position, but she was now standing a metre to the left. In under a second, she must have moved, or he must have had a shiver go through his body to miss the shot.  
  
*"Tch. All of you are the same."* She scoffed, her expression having changed from being neutral to clearly being annoyed. The man with the pistol stayed frozen in place, struggling, no, completely unable to process the absurdity of what he just witnessed. He opens his mouth, trying to express his mind, but finds himself short on words. The briefcase he saw her running with just moments ago had vanished out of sight, and that is already disregarding the fact she managed to dodge a bullet, a bullet!  
  
*"I'll take my leave, if you have nothing to say."* She sighed. The man lowered his pistol in defeat, his finger leaving the trigger. **"H-How.. do you do.. such things?"** He stammered, his eyes following the figure of the woman that was walking past him, now having stopped beside him. She smirked, her shimmering eyes gazing him directly into his soul as she formulated her reply with a smug expression on her face. *"You're slow, and you're predictable. Two steps separate us. You're one step behind, and I'm one ahead."* She laughed, breaking the staredown as she continued forward to walk out of the alley, into the open street.  
  
*"Do me a favour. Don't poke the bear again. It'll help you out."*

Still stunned, the guard looked behind him, only facing the back of the young woman turn around the corner. Deflated, and defeated, he sighs deeply, and finally walks forward out of the alleyway. 

### Confrontation, with difficulty
*// This section might undergo a rewrite, to properly introduce Maria to Raléi, as well as the rest of the existing Travel Risk cast.*

A weapon raised once more. A briefcase held tightly in the other hand. But this time around, it was the young woman herself that was looking down the narrow and short barrel of a pistol. The neutral expression that was on her face while confronting the guard was prominent yet again, as she broke the awkward silence and addressed the person at the end of the barrel, her hands raised. *"Agency, isn't it? What brings you here to me?"* \
The woman before her barrel chuckled, raising her hands in the air to admit defeat already. Her blue, slightly wavy hair shined brightly in the sunlight. **"You're young. Do you know what you're doing?"** She asked with a gentle, and innocent smile. She meant no harm, that much was for sure, but Maria didn't take any further risks after already encountering troubles earlier. *"I might be. But I don't do second guessing. What brings you here to me?"* \
**"Curiosity."** The woman replied with a wider smile. **"You're skilled. I mean no harm, nor do I need the briefcase you're holding. Let's point the gun down and talk it out, shall we, Maria?"** \
Maria complied immediately upon hearing her own name, and returned the pistol into her pocket, sighing deeply. *"At least put on a bit more of a contest, Raléi."* She laughed, the tense atmosphere between the two dissipating within a second. She clutched the briefcase tightly in her left hand, poking Raléi's side with her other hand. *"You're still tensed up from the Kristensend Ball, let's ease up with a coffee, I'll treat."* She said with a wide smile, almost leaning against Raléi. 
### Cooperation, not confrontation
Raléi sighed deeply, taking a long sip of her coffee upon finishing with talking. The two had taken a seat at a nearby café not too far away from the alley that Maria had intercepted the briefcase, but after scouting the area and making sure there were no more members of Dáritke left to track her down, the two finally could take a breather and catch up properly again. *"I take it Kasper is now in the leading role?"* She asked, taking a sip of her own coffee as well, intrigued to learn what really happened after the Kristensend Ball earlier in the week. She had made a surprise appearance to both Raléi and Nils, but ever since she had been off the radar until now. Raléi nodded in response, placing her cup back on the table again. **"I'm pretty sure he's been hospitalised. Just last month he was in top shape, if I had to believe Nils. It's the same that happened with Gustavo, his health suddenly plummeted."** She said with a neutral expression on her face, resting her head against her hand that was footed on the table. **"It's the same that's happening to Omáti too, but he's been keeping up better than the other two.."** \
*"You're not picking up arms against Dáritke, are you?"* Maria suddenly interrupted, as if she had read Raléi's mind. With a surprised expression, she averted her eyes to the side, trying to dodge the question at hand. *"You don't need to keep things from me, Raléi."* Maria continued, a genuine smile on her face as her deep green eyes shimmered under the sunlight. *"We share a common goal if so, and even with that, I'd much prefer spending more time with you rather than observing the Metro again."* She giggled, finishing her own cup of coffee before continuing to gaze into Raléi's troubled eyes. With a quiet sigh, she got up, finishing the last sip of her coffee as well before putting her jacket lined with a teal stripe once more. A wide smile appeared on her face as she returned her eyes to Maria's. **"Then let's get moving, shall we? We have much more to catch up on."**
 

## NINE - Challenging Fate
### Synopsis
**Raléi** and **Maria** teamed up together, and Maria's knowledge of the security systems and schedules of the Álef Metro gave the newly formed duo the upper hand in reaching and infiltrating a Dáritke stronghold. Even though Gustavo had **died ten years ago** (*// requires a recalculation*), the legacy he left behind remained in the mysterious, grim agency, and it grew more and more akin to a mafia day by day. Raléi and Maria agree on the spot to take down Dáritke as a whole together, and with weapons loaded, they breach through the stronghold to make a stand.
### Drafted layout
*// Stepping through what was once a familiar place, Maria makes a surprise return to Kristánisin's Agency, being reintroduced to Nils and meeting Omáti. While Omáti spends most of his time doing research and creating mission plans with his declining health, the remaining three now find themselves with a common goal: Take down Dáritke. Maria's knowledge that she acquired during her internship (Which she had only recently finished) is proved to be useful, and her memories of seeing strange activity on the camera's while supervising the security of the metro seemed vital as well, giving the members of the Agency a point to break into a Dáritke Stronghold. The mission seemed clear as day, and going through the arsenal to stock up, the three set off towards Álef.*

## TEN - By a Hair's Width
### Synopsis
Taking down an incredibly well-organised agency is much easier said than done, and Raléi and Maria narrowly escape from the freshly-infiltrated stronghold in Álef, leaving a target on the both of their heads for the rest of their lives. With **Nils** now tagging along, the three breach and break through into the Dáritke stronghold, but ultimately being met with a retaliating force much greater than they had expected.
### Drafted layout
*// Despite manoeuvring effortlessly through the narrow halls of the Álef underground Metro, breaching and clearing through a stronghold sounds great on paper, but is much more impossible when put to practice. Forcing their way into an emergency door, they are almost immediately caught and met with a retaliating force, something that catches even Maria off guard. Despite herself narrowly avoiding any damage, Raléi gets tagged and hit while Nils gets the worst of it all. Through sheer luck, the three manage to retreat back out of the stronghold and manage to clear the nearest traces towards their location.*

## ELEVEN - What Hides Under Álef
### Synopsis
**The Agency** is now a target to **Dáritke**, and the patriotic members of the latter do not mess around with assigned targets. The bounty hunt on Raléi and Maria continues, which forces the two to dwell around through the packed metro system of Álef, in hopes to stay out of sight, and in hopes to arm themselves for when the inevitable strikes. *// During **TEN**, Nils gets terribly injured and is forced to retreat and make his way back to Ákros, splitting from the rest of the group. After coming back to his senses in the underground of Álef, he is brought over to the hospital in Ákros by Omáti, and will not reappear in the remainder of the story anymore.* 
### Drafted layout
*// Having passed out from the blood loss from the gunshot wounds, Nils is revived by Maria and almost immediately tended to by the two young women. If it wasn't clear yet, it for sure was now: Nils wouldn't be able to aid them in their fight anymore, and with Omáti coming into help the three and pick up Nils to carry him towards the hospital in Ákros. This leaves the wounded Raléi and experienced Maria walking through the Álef underground, fully aware that there are now two enormous targets laced to their backs.*
### Awaken 
The voices were feint, and his body felt numb. Odd, scrambled memories ran through his mind while I could feel something poking and pressing against his arms and chest. **"Raléi.. NE-5.."** The voice echoed in the far distance. He felt paralysed, and the memories swirling around in his head remained nothing more than just that. An enormous puzzle was forming, but he wasn't able to solve it and complete the picture. **"Hurt a lot.. Sorry Nils.."** The voice whispered, having gotten closer to his ears for just a moment before he could feel something poke into his chest, putting his entire body under stress he had never felt before. He gasped for air, opening his eyes but instead seeing a blur before him. His body rapidly returned to his senses, but the pain and numbness that he was feeling just a moment ago were now gone, and trying to move his hand to his face, he was instead held back in place by the young woman to his right. **"Don't move yet, Nils, you're in shock."** She whispered, and Mila recognised the voice to be Maria's. Exhaling deeply, he could see Raléi to his left as his vision slowly began to return to normal. *"What's.. wh.."* He mumbled, staring up to the ceiling to see the dim light illuminating the stone ceiling of the tunnel above him. **"You were hit the worst after we escaped the stronghold, Nils."** Maria sighed, pressing another syringe into his arm and slowly numbing the pain that was making a return in his body. **"It's a miracle you're still kicking."** She continued, wrapping a bandage around his leg after having taken out a bullet shell from it. **"Omáti is on his way, he'll bring you to the Ákros hospital, we can only tend to you so much."** \  
Nils sighed deeply, slowly but surely feeling his senses return to normal, whatever his new normal might be. *"Did we.. achieve it?"* He asked, struggling to breathe as another syringe entered his upper arm. Both Maria and Raléi remained quiet, and feeling a makeshift pillow get placed under his head, he already felt like his question was answered. **"Stay kicking, Nils, Omáti is here in a minute."** Maria instructed, her voice having changed into a more serious tone as the wrapped another bandage around his bleeding arm. **"You're going to recover in Ákros. Raléi and I will make sure this won't be in vain."**


## TWELVE - TARGETING // TARGETED
### Synopsis
**Maria**'s knowledge of the ins and outs of the Álef Metro shine brightly, and with a stroke of luck, the two manage to intercept various Dáritke mercenaries and stock up. With restocked arms and confidence, the two begin their second attempt at infiltrating and bringing down Dáritke with a new approach: Targeting those, that are targeting them.
### Drafted layout
*// Maria and Raléi manoeuvre swiftly through the backalleys and halls of the Álef Metro, her knowledge shining brightly and her experience granting them a sliver of hope, and a stroke of luck. Eavesdropping on the various Dáritke mercenaries, the two ambush and intercept a group unexpectedly to stock up. With restocked arms and confidence, the two begin a new approach: Targeting those are targeting them, and working their way into Dáritke as such, to take them down from the bottom up.*

## THIRTEEN - AT ONE'S WITS' END // ONE LAST STAND
### Synopsis
Maria's strength begins to dwindle after being exposed to the continuous stress that comes with taking the lives of others, and her genius begins to fail her. Combined with Raléi's wounds beginning to wear her down, the two reach what feels like a dead end once more. The two make their way to the metro station of Álef-Nórem, which Maria remembered to have plenty of hallways and alleys to hide in and navigate through, but Dáritke finally found themselves one step ahead, and had armed the entire station with explosives, also eager to end the lives of the two women now that they were boxed in without an exit. Raléi's wounds have slowed her down too much, and before the two realised they had walked right into Dáritke's trap, the fuse had already been lit and the metro station initiated the self-destruction sequence. The crunching of steel beams collapsing from above echoes through the tunnels, and despite her best effort, Maria can't manage to save Raléi from the imminent debris, and is forced to watch her disappear behind the smoke, dust, and steel.
## EPILOGUE - Álef At Dawn
### Synopsis
The Agency doesn't last another day after the gruesome incident in Álef. Raléi's seat is left vacant, with no successor that was willing to take her place. Anyone who did, would immediately receive a target on their heads. Maria remains in Álef-Nórem for the remainder of the day, watching the sunrise with the collapsed metro station behind her, where her colleague, her close friend, her partner, had lost her life not even a day ago. The hope the two shared to restore Máneá and Zakh'háfo to peaceful nations was dwindling, and the dream seemed impossible to reach. 

### A mind full, a heart empty
The sun was beginning to rise in the far distance, its orange glow bidding farewell to the blackness of the night sky. Through her eyes, she could see that the dust had already settled a long while ago, and uneasily swinging her legs while sitting on the edge of the rooftops, she gazed at the moon, and at the stars whose light was being hidden by the light of Choreos. She sighed deeply, the trail of smoke from her cigarette slowly peeling away the roll of paper wrapped around the tobacco that she held between her fingertips. She felt deflated, she felt hopeless, and averted her eyes from the stars, where she knew Raléi was hiding herself between. One star continued to sparkle, even with the glow of the rising sun causing the others to disappear from the sky, eagerly waiting for the sun to set before they could shine brightly in the night sky once more. Tears dwelled up in her eyes, and taking one more puff from her cigarette, she dropped it to the floor, watching the feint orange tip fall to the floor, bouncing off the concrete tiles that were coated with dust and debris. 

The Agency was done for, that much she knew. With Raléi gone, she herself wouldn't be able to take her seat left vacant with a million dollar target on her head. If she would place herself in Raléi's shoes, it would only be a matter of days before Dáritke would pierce a bullet through her head too. Omáti wouldn't be able to fill the shoes either, his health deteriorated too much, and even though Raléi considered Nils to be a prodigy, she felt that he would be far too inexperienced to take control of such an important agency. \
Hiding her face in her hands, she wiped away the tears that had built up in her eyes, and sighed deeply. Her gaze returned to the floor beneath her, the lack of traffic not surprising her after the Metro station had collapsed. Nobody would dare set foot in Nórem for another few days, until someone brave enough would pick up the scraps. 

The young woman stood up and turned around, facing the collapsed remains of the roof once more. With a heavy heart, she walked towards the wreckage, the memories replaying in her head once more. The noise was deafening, the crunching of concrete, the screeching of the rails, all echoed through her head over and over again. But she didn't bother. The worst had already happened, the damage had already been dealt, and with tears streaming down her cheeks, she carefully made her way down towards the fateful accident site, sliding down the collapsed sheets of concrete, crawling down the steel beams, before coming face to face with the wreckage of the metro train in the station hall. A gaping hole was visible, the bottom being filled exclusively with remains of the walls, the floors, and the roof. 

She clutched her heart, fighting through the physical and emotional pain, and refusing to show weakness to anyone watching her. Dáritke would keep a bounty on her head in the near future, and as long as she stayed in Zakh'háfo, it wouldn't disappear. But frozen in place, gazing at the pit, gazing at the debris, gazing into what felt like the abyss, she smiled as she witnessed the accident before her once more, Raléi's last words now sounding as clear as day to her. 

**"Maria!"** She had yelled, reaching her hand out to her while the floor beneath her collapsed.

**"Live!"**
