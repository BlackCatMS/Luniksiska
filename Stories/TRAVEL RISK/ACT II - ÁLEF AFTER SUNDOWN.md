# ÁLEF AFTER SUNDOWN
## Synopsis
*// This synopsis no longer matches the existing direction that Act II is going towards, meaning it needs to be updated.*

The deals come out at night, hidden in the alleys of **Álef**. Its automated transport system makes frequent travel between trading hotspots a breeze, and **Maria** knows this by heart. In an attempted interception of a trade, she comes in contact with **Raléi**, from **The Agency**, and the two agree on a ceasefire for the time being, and to combine their strengths to figure out who is intercepting their respective trades. Despite not being part of an agency, **Maria** is especially skilled in close-quarters combat, and looks are especially deceiving with her build. 

## EIGHT - Álef After Sundown
### Confrontation, with ease
*"Why raise your weapon? You don't know me."*  
  
The woman quietly laughed, showing no signs of fear despite being on the receiving end of the barrel of a pistol. Her hair was short, but wavy, round glasses decorated her otherwise pale face, resting on her nose just above her freckles. She didn't appear like a person that excelled in a combat situation that she found herself in, but even so, her guard wouldn't go down.  
  
**"Don't play games, I've seen you intercept that briefcase."** The booming voice of the man replied, bouncing against the narrow walls in the alleyway they found themselves in. Looking down the short barrel of his pistol, the woman before him raised her arms, shrugging in response. *"I've no clue what you're on about."* She began, looking around her, below her, behind her. *"You clearly know what you're looking for, but I don't see it. Where's this briefcase you desperately want, then?"*  
  
Instead of a loud voice, the sound of a loud bang now passed through the alley, echoing and dissipating into the openness of the adjacent streets. But no sound follows, and the bang of the pistol fades away into the distance. The man's eyes opened widely, dumbfounded at the sight before him. Through the iron sights, he was aiming right at the forehead of the woman he was facing. But after firing, his pistol stayed in the same place, facing the exact same position, but she was now standing a metre to the left. In under a second, she must have moved, or he must have had a shiver go through his body to miss the shot.  
  
*"Tch. All of you are the same."* She scoffed, her expression having changed from being neutral to clearly being annoyed. The man with the pistol stayed frozen in place, struggling, no, completely unable to process the absurdity of what he just witnessed. He opens his mouth, trying to express his mind, but finds himself short on words. The briefcase he saw her running with just moments ago had vanished out of sight, and that is already disregarding the fact she managed to dodge a bullet, a bullet!  
  
*"I'll take my leave, if you have nothing to say."* She sighed. The man lowered his pistol in defeat, his finger leaving the trigger. **"H-How.. do you do.. such things?"** He stammered, his eyes following the figure of the woman that was walking past him, now having stopped beside him. She smirked, her shimmering eyes gazing him directly into his soul as she formulated her reply with a smug expression on her face. *"You're slow, and you're predictable. Two steps separate us. You're one step behind, and I'm one ahead."* She laughed, breaking the staredown as she continued forward to walk out of the alley, into the open street.  
  
*"Do me a favour. Don't poke the bear again. It'll help you out."*

Still stunned, the guard looked behind him, only facing the back of the young woman turn around the corner. Deflated, and defeated, he sighs deeply, and finally walks forward out of the alleyway. 

### Confrontation, with difficulty
A weapon raised once more. A briefcase held tightly in the other hand. But this time around, it was the young woman herself that was looking down the narrow and short barrel of a pistol. The neutral expression that was on her face while confronting the guard was prominent yet again, as she broke the awkward silence and addressed the person at the end of the barrel, her hands raised. *"Agency, isn't it? What brings you here to me?"* \
The woman before her barrel chuckled, raising her hands in the air to admit defeat already. Her blue, slightly wavy hair shined brightly in the sunlight. **"You're young. Do you know what you're doing?"** She asked with a gentle, and innocent smile. She meant no harm, that much was for sure, but Maria didn't take any further risks after already encountering troubles earlier. *"I might be. But I don't do second guessing. What brings you here to me?"* \
**"Curiosity."** The woman replied with a wider smile. **"You're skilled. I mean no harm, nor do I need the briefcase you're holding. Let's point the gun down and talk it out, shall we, Maria?"** \
Maria complied immediately upon hearing her own name, and returned the pistol into her pocket, sighing deeply. *"At least put on a bit more of a contest, Raléi."* She laughed, the tense atmosphere between the two dissipating within a second. She clutched the briefcase tightly in her left hand, poking Raléi's side with her other hand. *"You're still tensed up from the Kristensend Ball, let's ease up with a coffee, I'll treat."* She said with a wide smile, almost leaning against Raléi. 
### Cooperation, not confrontation
Raléi sighed deeply, taking a long sip of her coffee upon finishing with talking. The two had taken a seat at a nearby café not too far away from the alley that Maria had intercepted the briefcase, but after scouting the area and making sure there were no more members of Dáritke left to track her down, the two finally could take a breather and catch up properly again. *"I take it Kasper is now in the leading role?"* She asked, taking a sip of her own coffee as well, intrigued to learn what really happened after the Kristensend Ball earlier in the week. She had made a surprise appearance to both Raléi and Nils, but ever since she had been off the radar until now. Raléi nodded in response, placing her cup back on the table again. **"I'm pretty sure he's been hospitalised. Just last month he was in top shape, if I had to believe Nils. It's the same that happened with Gustavo, his health suddenly plummeted."** She said with a neutral expression on her face, resting her head against her hand that was footed on the table. **"It's the same that's happening to Omáti too, but he's been keeping up better than the other two.."** \
*"You're not picking up arms against Dáritke, are you?"* Maria suddenly interrupted, as if she had read Raléi's mind. With a surprised expression, she averted her eyes to the side, trying to dodge the question at hand. *"You don't need to keep things from me, Raléi."* Maria continued, a genuine smile on her face as her deep green eyes shimmered under the sunlight. *"We share a common goal if so, and even with that, I'd much prefer spending more time with you rather than observing the Metro again."* She giggled, finishing her own cup of coffee before continuing to gaze into Raléi's troubled eyes. With a quiet sigh, she got up, finishing the last sip of her coffee as well before putting her jacket lined with a teal stripe once more. A wide smile appeared on her face as she returned her eyes to Maria's. **"Then let's get moving, shall we? We have much more to catch up on."**

## NINE - Challenging Fate
### Synopsis
**Raléi** and **Maria** teamed up together, and Maria's knowledge of the security systems and schedules of the Álef Metro gave the newly formed duo the upper hand in reaching and infiltrating a Dáritke stronghold. Even though Gustavo had **died ten years ago** (*// requires a recalculation*), the legacy he left behind remained in the mysterious, grim agency, and it grew more and more akin to a mafia day by day. Raléi and Maria agree on the spot to take down Dáritke as a whole together, and with weapons loaded, they breach through the stronghold to make a stand.
### Drafted layout
*// Stepping through what was once a familiar place, Maria makes a surprise return to Kristánisin's Agency, being reintroduced to Nils and meeting Omáti. While Omáti spends most of his time doing research and creating mission plans with his declining health, the remaining three now find themselves with a common goal: Take down Dáritke. Maria's knowledge that she acquired during her internship (Which she had only recently finished) is proved to be useful, and her memories of seeing strange activity on the camera's while supervising the security of the metro seemed vital as well, giving the members of the Agency a point to break into a Dáritke Stronghold. The mission seemed clear as day, and going through the arsenal to stock up, the three set off towards Álef.*

## TEN - By a Hair's Width
### Synopsis
Taking down an incredibly well-organised agency is much easier said than done, and Raléi and Maria narrowly escape from the freshly-infiltrated stronghold in Álef, leaving a target on the both of their heads for the rest of their lives. With **Nils** now tagging along, the three breach and break through into the Dáritke stronghold, but ultimately being met with a retaliating force much greater than they had expected.
### Drafted layout
*// Despite manoeuvring effortlessly through the narrow halls of the Álef underground Metro, breaching and clearing through a stronghold sounds great on paper, but is much more impossible when put to practice. Forcing their way into an emergency door, they are almost immediately caught and met with a retaliating force, something that catches even Maria off guard. Despite herself narrowly avoiding any damage, Raléi gets tagged and hit while Nils gets the worst of it all. Through sheer luck, the three manage to retreat back out of the stronghold and manage to clear the nearest traces towards their location.*

## ELEVEN - What Hides Under Álef
### Synopsis
**The Agency** is now a target to **Dáritke**, and the patriotic members of the latter do not mess around with assigned targets. The bounty hunt on Raléi and Maria continues, which forces the two to dwell around through the packed metro system of Álef, in hopes to stay out of sight, and in hopes to arm themselves for when the inevitable strikes. *// During **TEN**, Nils gets terribly injured and is forced to retreat and make his way back to Ákros, splitting from the rest of the group. After coming back to his senses in the underground of Álef, he is brought over to the hospital in Ákros by Omáti, and will not reappear in the remainder of the story anymore.* 
### Drafted layout
*// Having passed out from the blood loss from the gunshot wounds, Nils is revived by Maria and almost immediately tended to by the two young women. If it wasn't clear yet, it for sure was now: Nils wouldn't be able to aid them in their fight anymore, and with Omáti coming into help the three and pick up Nils to carry him towards the hospital in Ákros. This leaves the wounded Raléi and experienced Maria walking through the Álef underground, fully aware that there are now two enormous targets laced to their backs.*
### Awaken 
The voices were feint, and his body felt numb. Odd, scrambled memories ran through his mind while I could feel something poking and pressing against his arms and chest. **"-Raléi.. NE-5.."** The voice echoed in the far distance. He felt paralysed, and the memories swirling around in his head remained nothing more than just that. An enormous puzzle was forming, but he wasn't able to solve it and complete the picture. **"-hurt a lot.. Sorry Nils.."** The voice whispered, having gotten closer to his ears for just a moment before he could feel something poke into his chest, putting his entire body under stress he had never felt before. He gasped for air, opening his eyes but instead seeing a blur before him. His body rapidly returned to his senses, but the pain and numbness that he was feeling just a moment ago were now gone, and trying to move his hand to his face, he was instead held back in place by the young woman to his right. **"Don't move yet, Nils, you're in shock."** She whispered, and Mila recognised the voice to be Maria's. Exhaling deeply, he could see Raléi to his left as his vision slowly began to return to normal. *"What's.. wh.."* He mumbled, staring up to the ceiling to see the dim light illuminating the stone ceiling of the tunnel above him. **"You were hit the worst after we escaped the stronghold, Nils."** Maria sighed, pressing another syringe into his arm and slowly numbing the pain that was making a return in his body. **"It's a miracle you're still kicking."** She continued, wrapping a bandage around his leg after having taken out a bullet shell from it. **"Omáti is on his way, he'll bring you to the Ákros hospital, we can only tend to you so much."** \  
Nils sighed deeply, slowly but surely feeling his senses return to normal, whatever his new normal might be. *"Did we..?"* He asked, struggling to breathe as another syringe entered his upper arm. Both Maria and Raléi remained quiet, and feeling a makeshift pillow get placed under his head, he already felt like his question was answered. **"Stay kicking, Nils, Omáti is here in a minute."** Maria instructed, her voice having changed into a more serious tone as the wrapped another bandage around his bleeding arm. **"You're going to recover in Ákros. Raléi and I will make sure this won't be in vain."**

It didn't take much longer for Omáti to arrive, and hidden near the emergency door that they had closed behind them after escaping from Dáritke's stronghold, the three now tended to the heavily wounded Nils. His breathing had finally stabilised, but he was still in a terrible shape. Maria sighed deeply in defeat, holding her hand over her mouth as the seriousness of it all began to dawn upon her. She and Raléi had nearly lost an esteemed member of their Agency, someone who was lured into this circuit by no means of his own. His own words has caught up on him. **"High risk, high reward."** She had told Maria after meeting her properly just under a week ago. Before her eyes, she could see Nils's parents, and Nils himself reuniting in France with them. It was his dream that she saw before her, but the vision faded as quickly as it appeared, bringing Maria back to the grim reality as Omáti placed Nils on the stretcher. He was covered in bandages, his leg was torn, and he could barely move by himself. *"I came with the van for this, it won't be a pleasant drive for him, but he's a tough guy, he'll kick through it."* Omáti smiled, pressing his hand firmly against Maria's shoulder to ease her up and relieve her from the haunting image she was trapping herself within. Exhaling deeply, she struggled to formulate her words, her emotions beginning to eat away her thought process, only allowing a quiet **"Thank you.."** leaving her lips. She glanced at Raléi for a moment, who was still tending to Nils and giving him another painkiller. She too knew that it wouldn't be an easy way back out of the metro, and it would be an extreme risk for the two women to escort Omáti as well, especially with Dáritke now having laced a target to their backs. **"Stay safe, Omáti."** Maria mumbled, watching him depart while pushing Nils forward on the stretcher. *"I should be the one telling you that, Maria."* He said back, waving at the two young women, fully aware that there was a looming risk that this would be the very last time he would be seeing them. *"You're strong, and smart! You'll find your way out together!"* He shouted, a wide smile on his face as he turned back around. Exhaling deeply, Maria broke her focus on the disappearing stretcher in the distance and instead face the floor, her courage beginning to sink away beneath her. But a press against her side from Raléi immediately snapped her out of her downwards spiral in her mind, and looking to her right, she was met with a wide smile on her face. *"We should move on as well, it won't last long before the door gets breached."* Raléi smiled, her hand slowly making its way towards her own. Maria nodded slowly, swallowing away the doubts and fears in her mind, and grabbed her partner's hand tightly, regained confidence appearing on her face as she smiled brightly. **"We'll find a way out together."** She smiled, repeating Omáti's words as she looked into the far distance. Their silhouettes had already vanished, but the worries she once had about their safety were now washed away completely. They too, would find a way to Ákros safely, and even with how terrible Nils's physique was at the moment, it wouldn't take long before everything would turn out for the better again.
### What hides under Álef
Tracing the walls, Maria began to warm up into what she once considered her home. Day in, day out, she would keep surveillance over the metro halls, managing the automated metro, and keeping an eye on every corner of the underground tunnels. To her, she knew the tunnels like the back of her hand, and right now, it would prove to be vital. **"There should be a hideout near Siftka."** She whispered to Raléi, who was following closely beside her while continuously holding her hand. The two didn't allow anyone or anything to separate the two anymore, and while Maria continued to follow her senses and traced the walls, Raléi kept an eye out on the other ends of the hallway. It was a dream duo, and before long, it would bear its fruits.

**""Left here."** Maria whispered, her deep green eyes shimmering in the dim light of the tunnels as she looked back at Raléi. **"This leads to the Siftka underground. We can find a stay there for the rest of the day."** Raléi nodded, and looking behind her, she made sure to not leave behind a single trace. Their backpacks were half-full, and they were both fully aware that neither of them would survive too much longer on empty stomachs. Pausing momentarily, Maria checked her watch. It was already nearing midnight, and it had totally flown past her that they had breached the stronghold late in the afternoon. Time had breezed past, and the exhaustion was slowly beginning to get to them. *"I see a bench, darling."* Raléi suddenly whispered, and clearing the rest of the tunnel, Maria nodded with a wide smile, setting course towards the bench. **"That'll be our bed for the night, then."** She groaned in response, eyeing the flat, stone surface. She already felt a shiver go through her body upon the thought of laying down on top of it, but she also knew that she simply had no other choice. They were nowhere close to Kristánisin right now, and going overground would take longer and put them at risk of being spotted by Dáritke mercenaries. Raléi sighed deeply, taking off her backpack as she loosened the bandage around her wrist, revealing the remainder of a gunshot wound from not too long ago. Sitting down on the bench, Maria was quick to follow, almost immediately glueing herself against Raléi to warm each other up, the exhaustion now finally beginning to get to her senses. **"It's just.. one night.."** she yawned, pressing her head against Raléi's shoulder while taking a look at the wound on her wrist. **"This should heal just fine overnight, I'll bandage it tomorrow for you again to keep it from infections."** She smiled, her eyes glimmering as she looked deeply into Raléi's eyes, whose eyes also glowed back in response. The two stared for just a little longer, seconds becoming minutes, before the two finally broke the staredown as Maria closed her eyes, leaning forward to press her own lips against Raléi's, giving her a gentle and soft goodnight kiss. Reopening her eyes, Raléi smiled back warmly, wrapping her arm around her partner as she slowly closed her eyes again, whispering softly into Maria's ear. *"It's just one night like this.. we'll find our way home tomorrow."* She began, exhaling softly. *"Sleep well, Maria.."* 

***"Goodnight, love."***
 
## TWELVE - TARGETING // TARGETED
### Synopsis
**Maria**'s knowledge of the ins and outs of the Álef Metro shine brightly, and with a stroke of luck, the two manage to intercept various Dáritke mercenaries and stock up. With restocked arms and confidence, the two begin their second attempt at infiltrating and bringing down Dáritke with a new approach: Targeting those, that are targeting them.
### Drafted layout
*// Maria and Raléi manoeuvre swiftly through the backalleys and halls of the Álef Metro, her knowledge shining brightly and her experience granting them a sliver of hope, and a stroke of luck. Eavesdropping on the various Dáritke mercenaries, the two ambush and intercept a group unexpectedly to stock up. With restocked arms and confidence, the two begin a new approach: Targeting those are targeting them, and working their way into Dáritke as such, to take them down from the bottom up.*
### Targeting
*// Maria and Raléi successfully ambush a mercenary group that they caught off guard in Szebta, and successfully stock back up.*


### Targeted
*// Lightning doesn't strike twice, and reaching the lower levels of the station near Siftka where Maria had seen mercenaries before during her observance over the Álef Metro, the two decide to try and ambush this group too to guarantee their stocks and escape away from Zakh'háfo. But instead, they are met with a much greater retaliating force and suffer a combat situation, leaving Raléi heavily wounded. The two are forced to retreat and lose their prized belongings that they hadn't had for longer than a day, and closing a security vault behind her, Maria guides Raléi away from the mercenaries, setting course towards Nórem to rest and recover before their last stand.*

## THIRTEEN - ONE LAST STAND
### Synopsis
Maria's strength begins to dwindle after being exposed to the continuous stress that comes with taking the lives of others, and her genius begins to fail her. Combined with Raléi's wounds beginning to wear her down, the two reach what feels like a dead end once more. The two make their way to the metro station of Álef-Nórem, which Maria remembered to have plenty of hallways and alleys to hide in and navigate through, but Dáritke finally found themselves one step ahead, and had armed the entire station with explosives, also eager to end the lives of the two women now that they were boxed in without an exit. Raléi's wounds have slowed her down too much, and before the two realised they had walked right into Dáritke's trap, the fuse had already been lit and the metro station initiated the self-destruction sequence. The crunching of steel beams collapsing from above echoes through the tunnels, and despite her best effort, Maria can't manage to save Raléi from the imminent debris, and is forced to watch her disappear behind the smoke, dust, and steel.
### At one's wits' end
Their height difference didn't matter all too much anymore at this stage, and stumbling through the halls of the quiet metro tunnels, their heads were level with Raléi resting against Maria's shoulder. Bandages were now making up the majority of her makeshift clothing, and no matter how much she tried, she was hitting her limits too. The ever-lively Maria, too, was beginning to get exhausted. They hadn't spent a single night together in their own bed ever since they returned to the tunnels, and it was finally beginning to get at them. **"Hold on just a little further.."** Maria mumbled to her struggling partner, almost feeling like she was dragging two bodies towards the end of the metro station they were headed towards. Raléi groaned, barely able to keep up, stumbling along and trying to match Maria's footing, but struggling to do so. Her painkillers were already working out, and Maria knew that they couldn't last too much longer in the underground. One way or another, they had to return to the overground, facing all the risks that come with doing so. Dáritke still had a target on them, and with a deep sigh, Maria strengthened her footing and marched forward, carrying Raléi as comfortably as she could, knowing that it wouldn't be too much further.

**"Dead end.."** Maria sighed, reaching the end of the narrow tunnel and facing nothing more than a brick wall. **"I'll seat you down, easy now.."** She mumbled to Raléi, who was struggling to stay awake. **"Rest a moment, darling, I'll navigate a way to Nórem, I took a wrong turn."** She sighed, positioning Raléi into a comfortable position as she coughed loudly, her body shaking as she finally eased up after their long walk. Maria struggled to keep her tears at bay. They were completely drained of any sorts of medication, and they had lost the majority of kits that would be vital to tend to Raléi right now when they tried to ambush the mercenaries in Siftka. She hissed at herself at the thought of it, a tear finally finding its way past her eyes to roll down her cheek as she gazed at Raléi's terribly wounded self. **"If I'd not pushed it.."** she mumbled to herself, more tears rolling down her cheeks now that she was given a moment to rest herself too. **"If I'd not pushed it..!"** She grit her teeth, trying to keep her voice quiet to grant Raléi the most of her rest that she deserved. Her thoughts were beginning to haunt her nonetheless, and averting her eyes from Raléi, she buried her face in her hands, trying to keep herself from sniffing more loudly than she already was. Had they not ambushed the mercenaries, none of this would've happened. They would've found their way out of Álef, Nils would've recovered fine in Ákros while the rest fled to Jóthul. But catching herself, she looked back at Raléi, who had wrapped her arms around her stomach and had dozed off to rest for just a moment. **"If I'd not pushed it.. you wouldn't be.. wounded like this.. dying, Raléi, I'm sorry."** 

Swallowing away the rest of her tears, she wiped her eyes dry, looking around to face the deeper end of the narrow tunnel once more. Nórem would be towards the left, she remembered. She'd missed an exit, which had led them to the dead end in which they found themselves in right now. It was once intended to be an extension into the next direction that Álef was set to grow in, but the discovery of protected fauna put a halt to the project, and instead forced Álef to expand towards the west and north. Sighing deeply, she walked back sluggishly towards Raléi, sitting back down beside her and resting her hand on her arm. For now, they'd take a moment of rest. The walk towards Czerébti was already exhausting enough for herself, and she could only imagine just how much pain Raléi must have gone through just to reach here. She couldn't get herself to drag her in her current shape to Nórem, and before long, she could feel her eyes start to get heavy too. The cold air that loomed in the tunnels was oddly soothing, something that she didn't expect to get used to, especially considering she never expected to spend half a week sleeping in the tunnels in the first place. She eyed the ceiling and hallway that they were sitting in for camera's, but finding none, she gestured Raléi to rest against her shoulder. Her weight against her side was reassuring. Even if they were in a horrible shape, and were actively targeted with a bounty on their heads, they weren't watched in this very moment. Exhaling deeply, Maria stared at the ceiling above her. Even if they were wounded together, they were still fighting through this together. Raising her hand, she felt a shiver go through her body as she attempted something she hadn't done in years. She stretched out her hand, and opening hand towards the ceiling, she hoped to see the particles that she once saw floating in Kósfrii many years ago once more. And to her surprise, two particles appeared, with a feint, dim glow, circling around her index finger. A warm, yet troubled smile appeared on her face, and slowly closing her eyes, she lowered her hand once more and joined Raléi in a short slumber.
### We'll make it out
The distant rumble of a metro passing by in an adjacent tunnel woke Maria up from her peaceful sleep. Blinking a few times to reawaken her eyes, she remembered where she had guided Raléi and herself towards. With a deep sigh, she rubbed her eyes, followed by rubbing her entire face awake. Raléi was still pressing against her side, and one quick glance at her revealed that she was still fast asleep. A troubled smile appeared on Maria's face, and staring at her partner's deep blue hair shimmer in the dim tunnel lighting for just a moment, she carefully stood up to stretch. \
She took a deep breath, and held it in for a few seconds before exhaling deeply, letting go of every worry that had stirred up in her head. Raléi was obviously still wounded, but it was risky for them to stay here for much longer too. She fully knew that she couldn't have travelled underground without leaving a single trace, and it wouldn't take much longer for Dáritke to find their current hiding place either. Pressing her hand against her forehead, she stared at Raléi for another moment, checking the time on her watch on her other wrist. **"7:30.."** She sighed. She didn't want to wake Raléi up, but it was already much later than she had hoped. If Dáritke really wanted to trace and track the two down, they would already be on their way. 

Kneeling down next to Raléi, she gently shook her awake, already having searched through her own backpack to take out a shot of painkillers in advance, expecting her to still be in pain. With a soft and quiet groan, she woke up after a few seconds, swaying towards the left, before Maria caught her before she'd topple over. **"I'm here, darling.. take your time to wake up.."** Maria whispered. More gentle rumbling went through the tunnels as the next metro made its way past, and preparing the painkiller injection in advance, Raléi slowly woke up, groaning in pain as she opened her eyes to look at her left arm. The bleeding had continued overnight, and the bandage that was around her upper arm was soaked in a deep red. Not taking any time to doubt, Maria undressed herself to take off her undershirt, and immediately wrapped it tightly around Raléi's arm to staunch the bleeding. Gesturing to her to keep her voice down and not exert herself too much, she held the syringe with painkillers before her eyes, to which Raléi promptly nodded. **"I'll take your right arm, we're late, but I won't rush you.."** Maria sighed, injecting and emptying the syringe into Raléi's upper right arm before disposing of it in her bag. They had almost run out of any sort of medication, and they weren't in the proper shape to acquire new medications either. All they needed to do was make their way to Nórem now, and all that was left for them to do was to pray that luck would be in their favour. \
*"Nórem, wasn't it..?"* Raléi mumbled, looking up to Maria, who had stood back up again after finishing her backpack check. **"Nórem, yeah, I think I know how to get there."** She said back, her confidence having plummeted ever since she had brought them here in the first place. For the first time in ages, she had taken a wrong turn, and it felt like the map of the underground tunnels in her head was finally beginning to fade, leaving her taking the wrong turn. Taking a deep breath, Raléi lifted her right hand into the air, before getting picked and pulled up on her feet by Maria. Exhaling deeply, a troubled but warm smile appeared on her face. *"Then let's get going."*
### One last stand
Towards the left, and then forwards until finding an emergency exit sign. Then they'd have to walk past two of those signs, and then take the third. It would guide them into another, more public tunnel, and a stairwell would bring them towards the metro station of Álef-Nórem, their destination. Maria had walked the route several times during her internship, and had even made her way to the hideout they had come from just now once or twice before. An ambitious project halted by nature, that was all she knew, and in this moment, she couldn't care too much more either. Raléi's wounds had gradually healed overnight, but she was still nowhere near her proper shape. Every now and then, she'd rest on Maria's shoulder, before she'd finish resting and walk by herself again. Their hands were held together, their fingers intertwined. Wherever it was that destiny was set to bring them, they would face it together. Taking the third emergency exit, Maria peeked and cleared the stairwell with her pistol drawn. Despite it being low on ammo, she couldn't take any risks at all, but deeming it clear, she gestured Raléi to come climb the stairwell too. She wrapped her arm around Maria's neck, and taking their time together, they climbed towards the surface once more. 

*"Out of painkillers, right?"* Raléi whispered halfway through the stairwell. They still had two more floors to climb together, but Raléi's weight was beginning to pull on Maria's strength. She nodded in response, a worried expression appearing on her face as she whispered back. **"I gave you the last one this morning. Are you holding up?"** Raléi shook her head, and letting go of Maria, she sat down against the wall. *"Barely. I need a breather."* \
And so they did. Maria promptly sat down beside Raléi as she exhaled deeply. It would be two more floors, and then they'd reach the main floor of the Álef Metro, the main floor that was primarily underground. It would connect to the various districts and sister cities of Álef, but their own destination would be on the ground level. **"Line S72, exit Centrale, S1 to Ákros.."** Maria mumbled to herself, staring in front of her as she visualised the metro map onto the wall before her. But the map shook slightly as Raléi pressed against her shoulder once more, leaving Maria's eyes immediately darting towards her face, but instead being met with a reassuring sight. She had fallen asleep once more. With a warm smile on her face, Maria wrapped her arm around her, holding her close to herself and warming her up for just a little bit more. She inhaled and exhaled deeply, giving herself another moment to rest as well. Staring at the ceiling, she focused her hearing on her surroundings. The rumbling of the metro trains rushing past had become louder, and she could even pick out the different trainsets that were used now that the engines sounds became more clear to her. Every now and then, she could hear a series of footsteps exit and enter the different metros. Her smile on her face widened, the traffic in the metro meant that they could blend in with the crowd and make their way towards Ákros without being seen by any mercenaries from Dáritke again. It would be an incredible risk for them to take, especially with how wounded and roughed up the two looked, but with Raléi recovering under her arm, she knew that it would be their last stand together. It was either this, or death. 

Raléi shook herself awake, and Maria realised that she had dozed off herself too. Letting go of Raléi, she looked at her watch once more. **"8.30."** She whispered to herself, helping Raléi stand up once more as the two stretched themselves awake again. They had dozed off for just a few minutes, but even so, Raléi already looked to be in a much better shape. Taking off Maria's inner shirt from her left arm, she saw that the bleeding that persisted overnight had finally stopped, and placing it in her bag, she took Maria's hand and held it tightly, a newfound spark of confidence having appeared in her shimmering blue eyes. *"Ready?"* She whispered to Maria, whose expression changed from one with surprise and exhaustion, to one with confidence. **"Ready."** 

Almost immediately, the two made their way up towards the next levels, and it didn't take too much longer before they had reached the lower metro level. But arriving at the metro in the direction of Nódori, Maria already felt ticked off upon the sight of the platforms. **"It's.. awfully quiet.."** She whispered, freezing in place as she veered around the station hall for any clues. Raléi tugged against her arm, trying to get her to move forward and not stay in place for all too long. *"Rush hour's over, everyone went to work, it's nothing t-"* \
**"Rush hour is still on, and yet the station is dead!"** Maria interrupted her partner, a hint of fear in her voice as it trembled slightly. **"Something is wrong. Something is terribly wrong!"** She continued, her eyes darting around as she stumbled together with Raléi to reach the staircase towards the upper level. The metros that normally passed had slowed down, which indicated that someone else was in control of the metro system. More doubts stirred up in Maria's head as she eyed the various security cameras. Not even half a year ago, she was the one eyeing the tens of thousands of daily commuters through them, but in this very moment, she felt like she was the one being watched continuously by a higher power. Despite being in such a familiar environment, she felt alienated, and her partner being wounded only stirred up more worries in her mind. *"S72 to Centrale?"* Raléi asked, her tone having changed too. She had changed into a much more serious version of herself, realising too that they were both at a high risk. The entire station was completely devoid of any passengers, and even if Nórem wasn't a busy station to begin with, it wouldn't make any sense for it to be completely empty at a time like this. Maria nodded in response, and the two dragged each other to the corresponding platform. **"We're being watched, Raléi."** Maria hissed as the two arrived at the platform. Their hands were still intertwined, but Maria's left hand was now on her holstered pistol. Her brows were furrowed as she eyed every single surveillance camera that hung from the ceilings, and locking eyes with Raléi, she moved her hand to her own holstered weapon. Within the blink of an eye, they drew their weapons and shot the nearest security cameras, removing the direct sight of their whereabouts from whoever it was that was observing them. It would take two more minutes before the metro that would bring them towards the central station would arrive, but the uneasy feeling in Maria's gut remained. She tried to keep her breathing under control, holding Raléi's hand even tighter, the seconds ticking by ever so slowly.

Maria's eyes suddenly opened wide. In the far end of the tunnel to her left, she could pick up a track switch changing directions. Immediately looking to her left, the distant rumble of an approaching metro became more and more apparently. She eyed the tunnel in the distance, but more and more rumbling began to fill the station halls. Something terrible was up. \
*"It's not just you."* Raléi whispered, holding Maria's hand tightly as she held her close. *"Something is up. This station isn't automated anymore."* She looked around the various cameras that they shot as well, but looking upwards, she could feel her heart sink to the floor. *"Maria. Explosives."* 

A loud bang immediately fills the halls of the station, echoing through the tunnels and covering the platforms in a layer of dust. Whichever bomb it was, it was manually detonated with the intention of demolishing the metro station from the top to the bottom, fully aware that the two women were still inside and waiting for their metro. **"We need to leave!"** Maria shouted, her ears ringing as another bang came from the tunnel on their right, followed by the piercing sound of the rails deforming and snapping apart from the explosions. She held Raléi's hand as tightly as she possibly could, but she was struggling to keep up now that she was beginning to exhaust her body once more. Her wounds had yet to recover, and after already having exerted them too much making their way to Nórem to begin with, it was an enormous ask to exert them one more time to exit Nórem now that they were about to be the filling of a concrete sandwich. The ringing of the tracks continued, another explosive detonating on the roof as the steel support beams that had held up the roof finally gave way, folding and filling the halls with an ear-deafeningly loud piercing noise as they collapsed to the ground. The track that Maria and Raléi needed to board their metro on was now covered in debris. In any case, they would no longer be able to reach the central station by metro, and yet, one was approaching. The quiet whirrs of the electric engine was heading towards them rapidly, and it didn't take many more seconds before the beams of the metro lit up the left tunnel, illuminating it before emerging from it. It was approaching rapidly, and Maria immediately pushed herself and Raléi towards the wall. Someone was controlling the metros, whoever it was, they had assumed total control of the Álef Metro. Whoever it was, they had planned this out, they had traced their tracks, and were now performing the show right before their very eyes. 

Without any indication of stopping, the old trainset barged and crashed into the debris from the roof, derailing almost instantly as the remainder of the cars rubbed and pushed against the platform, causing sparks and dust to fill the hall as more explosives boomed through the underground. It suddenly made sense to Maria. From top to bottom, the station was being detonated. But there was another metro line beneath them, which could only mean-.

The floor beneath them crumbled, and before the two had even come to realise what was going on, Raléi had already lost her footing on the floor. Her wounds had caught up to her, the rumbling of the explosives denying her the opportunity to regain her balance, as the reflective tiles under the soles of her shoes cracked, and caved in. Maria's eyes opened wide, and before she properly understood the scope of the situation, she already knew she was too late. **"Raléi!!"** She yelled, reaching her hand out as adrenaline surged through her veins as she watched the floor beneath her partner give way. It all seemed to happen in slow-motion. Tears had already found their way onto her cheeks as she gritted her teeth, reaching her hand out as far as she possibly could, but it simply wasn't meant to be. Their eyes locked, and she could see a wide smile on her face as she followed her gaze, falling towards the abyss. The noise was deafening, and despite seeing her lips move, Maria couldn't figure out what it was she was saying to her. The platform gave way, the debris from the roof was quick to follow, and the cherry on the cake was the deformed trainset completing her grave-to-be. The rumbling stopped, the crunching of the steel echoed into the far distance, and the crunching of stone reached an end. The halls of the metro were now eerily quiet once more, the only noise that echoed being the sobbing of Maria, who had fallen to her knees beside the newly formed crater. In just the blink of an eye, their last stand was blown away effortlessly. In just the blink of an eye, she had disappeared. 

Forever.

## EPILOGUE - Álef At Dawn
### Synopsis
The Agency doesn't last another day after the gruesome incident in Álef. Raléi's seat is left vacant, with no successor that was willing to take her place. Anyone who did, would immediately receive a target on their heads. Maria remains in Álef-Nórem for the remainder of the day, watching the sunrise with the collapsed metro station behind her, where her colleague, her close friend, her partner, had lost her life not even a day ago. The hope the two shared to restore Máneá and Zakh'háfo to peaceful nations was dwindling, and the dream seemed impossible to reach. 

### A mind full, a heart empty
The sun was beginning to rise in the far distance, its orange glow bidding farewell to the blackness of the night sky. Through her eyes, she could see that the dust had already settled a long while ago, and uneasily swinging her legs while sitting on the edge of the rooftops, she gazed at the moon, and at the stars whose light was being hidden by the light of Choreos. She sighed deeply, the trail of smoke from her cigarette slowly peeling away the roll of paper wrapped around the tobacco that she held between her fingertips. She felt deflated, she felt hopeless, and averted her eyes from the stars, where she knew Raléi was hiding herself between. One star continued to sparkle, even with the glow of the rising sun causing the others to disappear from the sky, eagerly waiting for the sun to set before they could shine brightly in the night sky once more. Tears dwelled up in her eyes, and taking one more puff from her cigarette, she dropped it to the floor, watching the feint orange tip fall to the floor, bouncing off the concrete tiles that were coated with dust and debris. 

The Agency was done for, that much she knew. With Raléi gone, she herself wouldn't be able to take her seat left vacant with a million dollar target on her head. If she would place herself in Raléi's shoes, it would only be a matter of days before Dáritke would pierce a bullet through her head. Omáti wouldn't be able to fill the shoes either, his health deteriorated too much, and even though Raléi considered Nils to be a prodigy, she felt that he would be far too inexperienced to take control of such an important agency. \
Hiding her face in her hands, she wiped away the tears that had built up in her eyes, and sighed deeply. Her gaze returned to the floor beneath her, the lack of traffic not surprising her after the Metro station had collapsed. Nobody would dare set foot in Nórem for another few days, until someone brave enough would pick up the scraps. 

The young woman stood up and turned around, facing the collapsed remains of the roof once more. With a heavy heart, she walked towards the wreckage, the memories replaying in her head once more. The noise was deafening, the crunching of concrete, the screeching of the rails, all echoed through her head over and over again. But she didn't bother. The worst had already happened, the damage had already been dealt, and with tears streaming down her cheeks, she carefully made her way down towards the fateful accident site, sliding down the collapsed sheets of concrete, crawling down the steel beams, before coming face to face with the wreckage of the metro train in the station hall. A gaping hole was visible, the bottom being filled exclusively with remains of the walls, the floors, and the roof. 

She clutched her heart, fighting through the physical and emotional pain, and refusing to show weakness to anyone watching her. Dáritke would keep a bounty on her head in the near future, and as long as she stayed in Zakh'háfo, it wouldn't disappear. But frozen in place, gazing at the pit, gazing at the debris, gazing into what felt like the abyss, she smiled as she witnessed the accident before her once more, Raléi's last words now sounding as clear as day to her. 

**"Maria!"** She had yelled, reaching her hand out to her while the floor beneath her collapsed.

**"Live!"**

## Addendum
With nothing left to fight for anymore, Maria walks back towards the Central station by herself to return to Kristánisin for one last time. She'd bring the essentials for Omáti and Nils, who were still in the Ákros hospital, but for herself, she'd bring memorabilia from Raléi. Fully aware that the Agency's residence wouldn't last for much longer, she locks the door behind her and closes this chapter of her life, as much as it hurts.

In Ákros, she informs the ever-deteriorating Omáti and the gradually recovering Nils about what had happened in Álef, and what this means for the Agency, and for them. She explains to them that she's a prime target to Dáritke, and that this would probably be the last ever time that she'd see the old man and the young prodigy in her life. With a heavy heart, she waves goodbye, and departs to her home village in Jóthul once more. Escaping from Dáritke, and escaping from the past.
