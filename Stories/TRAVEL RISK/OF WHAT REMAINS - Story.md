# OF WHAT REMAINS - Story

### Draft
In **2062**, after almost three decades of quietness in **Illinois**, the ruling government controlled by **PALMER-EDEN** attempts to annex the states of **Iowa** and **Minnesota**, which had been in the region of the **Uncontrolled States**. This attack was retaliated by support from **Canada** and the **Southern States**, and as a result, Illinois collapsed and closed its borders from the public.

After the closure of its borders, Illinois stayed quiet while **Martin Palmer**, the CEO of **PALMER-EDEN**, now laid his eyes purely on his **Ultima** project.

### Of What Remains - Story
Story taking place in late 2075, laying the focus on the disparity between the now-flourishing **Southern States** and the closed-off nation of **Illinois** after its collapse from the attempted expansion and annexation of Minnesota and Iowa. 

### What Once Was
Story focusing on **Illinois** in late 2075, and the development and struggles that now grow more broadly within her borders during the increased development of **Ultima** and the **Palmer-Eden Tower**.

### NO FURTHER
Story that lays its eyes on the *Attempted Annexation* of Minnesota and Iowa in **2062**, which was immediately retaliated by **Canada** and the **Southern States**, who then immediately afterwards kept tight border control in order to prevent another attempt at expansion from happening. This story will focus on the development of this attempted expansion.
