This Character List belongs to [[TRAVEL RISK]].
## Nils Lorieux
Belongs to **The Agency** (Middleman). \
Equipped with neurotech, including **Wrist Rabbit** (Hacking protocol on wrist)
### Appearance
Rough visual reference: **Regis Altare** from **Holostars**.

Nils is a well-built but slim young man, who has since his acquisition into **The Agency** decided to dye his hair blue, to match the Agency's own colour palette of *Blue/Turqouise*. During his training within the Agency, he has opted to exchange his regular casual wear to a more formal type of clothing, wearing a dark blue suit rather than shirts and jeans, to match **Raléi's** outfit too.
### Backstory
Nils's backstory and the course of his life, is available at [[Backstories#Nils]].

## Raléi Alentikíles
Belongs to **The Agency** (Weapons Expert, Owner). \
Equipped with **Stealth Weaponry** (Blade hidden under wrist) and neurotech, including **Wrist Rabbit** (Hacking protocol on wrist) and **Adrenaline surges** (Pulsing streaks on left arm). 
### Appearance
Rough visual reference: **Ouro Kronii** from **Hololive**.

Looks are deceiving, and Raléi knows this. While sharing a similar outfit to **Nils**, a basic navy-blue suit, much more is hidden underneath. Her **Neurotech** was all installed on her left arm, which she accentuated with various tattoos as well, varying from tribal to futuristic and abstract. Having trained in martial arts and having mastered weaponry from melee through marksman rifles, she is a force to be reckoned with.
### Backstory
Raléi's backstory and the course of her life, is available at [[Backstories#Raléi]].

## Gustavo Dáritke
Belongs to **Dáritke** (Founder, Owner).

Rough visual reference: **Michael Andretti**.
## Antoine Rousseau
Belongs to **Dáritke** (Middleman).
## Mika Andzákin
Belongs to **Dáritke** (Robber, Netrunner, Weapons Expert). \
Equipped with various neurotech, including (but not limited to): **Wrist Rabbit** (Hacking protocol on wrist), **Adrenaline boosters** (In heart and legs), **Stealth weaponry** (Blade hidden under wrist). In addition to this, Mika also has a lot of exposed neurotech, most notably in his left arm, which is accented by sharp chrome and blue lines. 

Rough visual reference: **Mika Melatika (outfit 3)** from **Nijisanji**.
## Katherina "Nova" Mikkë
Belongs to **The Agency** (Weapons Expert). \
Equipped with various neurotech, including (but not limited to): **Adrenaline boosters** (Fitted on left arm), **Curious Eye** (Digitalised left eye), which can handle zoom and focus up to 4km in distance, and discolours from her natural blue through to yellow-green the further she looks.
### Appearance
Rough visual reference: **Pozëmka** from **Arknights**.

While still adjusting to her new silhouette, her visit to Cévok and connection to Dominico greatly helped her imminent deafness with the addition of characteristics of an *Arctic Fox*, accentuating her natural white/blonde hair colour. Being left handed, her neurotech is exclusively installed on her left arm and eyes, which glow a bright blue when in use. 
### Backstory
Nova's backstory and the course of her life, is available at [[Backstories#Nova]].
## Maria Limáida
*"Of course the public is cruel. They know no better standards, they haven't had the opportunity to."*  
  
Despite not being a strong or well-built person, Maria's strength lay in her extensive knowledge about combat, trading, and everything that has ever entered and exited the borders of Zakh'háfo. Originally from a small village near **Jóukmandar** in western **Jóthul**, she studied in Kristensend in Rhódisz, and eventually began her work in the capital of Zakh'háfo, Ákros. Starting as a junior security officer for the remaining company that kept its eyes on the **Álef Metro**, she was one of the first people to pick out the usual trade routes and meeting points that took place or passed through the various metro stations. From security officer, she gradually became a spy, picking up many stories, many names, and many routes, and supervised herself to dip her toes into the seemingly infinite spider web of illegal trade within Zakh'háfo.  
  
Even without Neurotech, "fear" wasn't a word in her dictionary. The knowledge she had acquired while spying on the various trade routes was enough for her to meddle in perfectly. "Dáritke", "Vátnelári", and "The Agency" weren't mysterious names to her anymore. Despite never having set a step inside any of the agencies, she knew them from inside out, and was only keen on learning more. Trades were happening, plenty of money was being laundered, and plenty of deaths were happening, too. She had no motive, no stance, but her interest kept peaking higher and higher. Whenever she wasn't sure about something, she needed to figure out the details, as soon as she possibly could.  
  
In [[ACT II - ÁLEF AFTER SUNDOWN]], she stumbles upon Raléi, the head of **The Agency**, after making an escape from a Dáritke guard. The two don't ignite a fight, and instead, Maria lays her knowledge of the situation on the table. She wasn't here to fight anyone, and Raléi didn't show hostility either. The two shake hands, and get to know each other more properly.  
  
Maria is very formal, and comes off as a very knowledgeable person. Even though she may not be as expressive as others, she has no cruel intentions or ill faith. As Raléi gets to know more about her, she too, recognises the value Maria would bring upon joining the Agency, especially with her knowledge about Zakh'háfo, and especially Álef. *// This proposal will be worked out on in a later chapter of Álef After Sundown.*
