# A NEW DAWN - Story
**A NEW DAWN** is a story that is in *active and early development*. It's set to focus on **SOLARdawn**'s **Western Wing**, especially focussing on the lifetime of **Polaris**. The outline is available at [[A NEW DAWN - Outline]].

# ACT I - IRRADIATE
## ONE - High Tension
**June 2nd, 2059** | **Oslo** \
**Emily Østengaard**
### Keep Focus
**"Blue skies are ahead."** Emily repeated to herself, taking a sip of her tea as she saw the government's banner appear on her feed once more. An incredibly ambitious plan, it was, and even though it was being communicated through the Norwegian government itself, it was a proposal and plan made not even by an institute located within Norway itself. The ESA had granted them an offer, one they believe that "They couldn't refuse". Emily's smirk grew wider as she swiped away the message for the third time this week. **"Not relevant to me.."** She whispered to herself, returning to her work that was laid out before her. Scattered all over her table were various flyers and papers, being pressed not just under, but over her peripherals before her monitor, giving any person that took a glance at her while passing through the hallways an impression that she was not doing any work at all, or was doing far more than she could handle at once. **"NORCE"** was written in the top left of every single one of the flyers, and evidently, it belonged to the institute that she was working under. And beneath her hands, all these flyers and papers, as well as what was displayed on her monitor, all belonged to the same project that she had been working towards together with her team. It was a project related to neural science, and it was an experimental program that explored the options of modifications to the human body in order to aid those that needed them most. It would be a means of allowing blind people to see once more, paralysed people to feel and walk once more, the deaf to hear, the chronically ill to heal, and so forth. There was no certain goal that her team was working towards, and yet, it would be an enormous leap for not just NORCE, but all of humanity, if implications like these could easily be helped through these methods. Even if they were already being developed on the sister planet Lúniks, Norway seemed to be on the forefront of the European movement for neurotech like this. And with that thought on her head, Emily breathed in deeply, and started to scour through the papers once more. \
*"You're not getting any work done with that pile of papers, are you?"* Esther, her supervisor, suddenly interrupted her, and taking her headphones off, Emily looked into the direction that her voice had come from, their blue eyes meeting one another. Pushing a strand of hair that had been covering her right eye to the side, she smiled warmly at her supervisor's face, their expressions mismatching, as Esther was frowning. **"You underestimate me."** Emily smiled back, taking a hold of a stack of papers and lifting them up for Esther to see. **"Ninety percent is already archived and put into the database. Just the pile under my keyboard is left."** She giggled, her legs swaying over the edge of her office seat. Emily was wearing brown jeans, decorated by a simple light-blue top, which didn't match the outfit that her supervisor was wearing. Instead of jeans, she was wearing a long straight skirt underneath a white blouse, which were underneath a plain white lab coat. But before she could get lost in her outfit and the mismatching colours, she was once again brought back to her senses as Esther crossed her arms, her brows remaining furrowed. *"No, I think I'm overestimating you, actually."* She replied firmly, eyeing the pile under her keyboard. *"We need to talk about this. Please come into my office after your break."* She simply continued, averting her eyes immediately after finishing, and stepped away from her desk, leaving Emily puzzled and wondering if there was something going on underneath, behind the scenes. Sighing quietly, she spun her chair back to face her desk, and rubbing her eyes, she returned to her monitor once. **"You're no fun.."** She mumbled to herself, pulling the last few papers from underneath her keyboard, and returned to finish up her work once more. 
### No time to rest
With a simple click on a button underneath her monitor, Emily's hour-long lunch break had begun, and stretching her arms up in the air to loosen them up, she stood up from her chair immediately. Letting it spin after standing up, she took her handbag and left for a little walk to ease her mind and to collect her thoughts. Even if she finished the work that she was supposed to have finished before her lunch break, the fact that Esther wanted her to come into her office still left her with an uneasy feeling in her stomach. What *was* going on behind the scenes? Was her work not enough? Her headphones were wrapped around her neck, and the only sounds that she could hear were the muffled noise of the tiles moving underneath the soles of her feet, the chirping of the birds in the trees above her, and the wind that was gently rustling the leaves in the very same trees. But after walking towards the bakery for a moment, another noise left her facing straight forward, into the direction the noise had come from. *"An explosion."* Emily thought to herself right away, and standing before a crosswalk that would lead her to her usual bakery, she instead moved into the direction the noise had come from, curiosity getting the better of her, especially since she knew she still had an hour left before her break would reach an end. It couldn't hurt to take a peek, right? \
Within a few minutes, Emily had made her way towards the direction of the noise, which seemed to repeat itself and echo between the various towers and skyscrapers in the very heart of her home city of Oslo. But peeking through a small alleyway, nothing had prepared her for the sight that she was about to see. *"Smoke."* She thought to herself, looking around her, desperately trying to find the source of the smoke, her eyes opened wide as she made the connection. Where there's smoke, there's fire, and her nose had picked up that very source too. Right behind the alleyway headed north, she could already feel the heat radiating into her direction, tickling her face while the summer sun was already doing plenty. Facing the increasingly worsening situation, she realised that she had gone too far to go back now. Even if there was a fire, and even if there was a plume of smoke joining the skyline amongst the other towers that were in the heart of Oslo, she was keen to figure out what it was that was happening. Marching forward, she could hear distant chants in the distance, and hearing the voices become louder with every step, she knew she was getting closer. With her handbag clutched tightly under her shoulder, Emily pressed forward through the last alleyway, now finally able to witness what exactly it was that was unfolding in the centre of Oslo. But with her eyes opening wide upon the very sight, she stood frozen in place, struggling to process what it was that was going on. Immediate regret went straight through her veins, but she was no longer able to walk back, her mind simply refused to. Her eyes couldn't avert it either, but her nightmares had come true right before them.

What was known as the tallest skyscraper in Oslo, a title that it had held since **2048**, was now burning right before her very eyes. Its base had been completely incinerated, and masses of people had gathered around it. Not with the intention to help, but as the lead cause for the tower's fire. Improvised roadblocks had been set up around them, the chanting was louder than ever, and multiple banners had been waving in the air the entire time. Flags of Norway, banners calling for action, banners mocking the face of the ESA, mocking the government of Norway. All of it was with the intention to bring the tower, which belonged to and housed the government, down to the ground. Along with all their ideas and ideals. Emily's hand flung to her mouth, covering it as she finally gained the confidence to turn around. No matter what the preface of this was, no matter the reasoning for the gathering of this enormous crowd, let alone the attempted destruction of a *government* tower, it had given Emily the strength and energy to step away from the imminent destruction site. She didn't care about the motives that they could have, she didn't care about whatever it was that the government could have done for them to be on the receiving end of such a criminally disgusting action. No matter what, she had to get out of here, *fast*. \
Holding her handbag tightly in her hands, she picked up the pace, she chants and bangs disappearing into the distance once more. *//*

*// Cont. Emily makes her way back to NORCE, and during the meeting with Esther, it is cut off short by the collapse of the government tower. The two realise that their own tower could very well be next, and ad hoc, their operations are paused immediately and indefinitely. This leaves Emily seeking a job once more, and realising that Oslo is no longer safe, the opportunity for PALMER-EDEN opens up.*

## TWO - OVERFLOW
**Chicago** \
**Emily Østengaard** 
### Sketch
*// Despite adjusting excellently to her new space within PALMER-EDEN, and being frequently accompanied by **Francis Ezarea**, a force outside of her control has led her into a state of war once more. With her projects disturbed, and her living situation greatly endangered, only one option is left for her and many other researchers and employees within the confines of PALMER-EDEN. And that is to leave for Lúniks, and leave for SOLARdawn.*

## THREE - POLE STAR
**Amadnésam** \
**Emily Østengaard**
### Sketch
*// Reaching Lúniks and establishing their own research division within the Western Wing of the SOLARdawn, Project CORE reaches completion, and Project POLARIS follows soon after. Every project is now centralised and supervised by one person: Polaris herself. *

# ACT II - POLARIS
## FOUR - AD INFINITUM
**Amadnésam** \
**Polaris**
### Sketch
*// Drafted: In relation to the Infinite Archive (The illusion thereof), Polaris interrupts and confronts someone who seemed to be seeking for things that were out of their reach.*

## FIVE - THE LITTLE THINGS
**Amadnésam** \
**Polaris**
### Sketch
*// Rough: "Routine" interaction between little Cisila and Polaris. Acts as a wind down chapter for the previous chapter.*
