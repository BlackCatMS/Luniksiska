### Activity log in the Western Wing, Polaris's quarters, monitored by Unit 2C - August 07th, 2075
*// A person is waiting at your door, Polaris. Their silhouette matches that of Ezarea. Course of action? //* \
**"Door's unlocked. Come inside."** The voice replied, her eyes locked on the small peephole at the very centre of the door. It was relatively reinforced, and although there had never been a threat of a break-in into this office before, it had been there from the very start, even before Polaris had moved into this room. The door was quite old, too, and creaked loudly as it was pushed forward, the small textile accent at the bottom of the door brushing along the floor as the silhouette that previously stood behind it, now stood in front of the door. *"Polaris."* He said quietly, bowing slowly and delicately. At least twenty metres separated the two, and yet, he could feel the tense atmosphere in the room even standing in the doorframe. *"I have a request to make."* \
**"You're at the right place. Come closer, Francis, I don't bite."** She replied immediately, smiling warmly as her head lifted upwards. Her eyes remained closed, only leaving Francis more nervous as he approached Polaris who was still seated at her desk. Her hands were held together, her elbows resting on the desk with her fingers intertwined. The door closed behind Francis, and his remaining footsteps echoed through the seemingly endless room. Every step seemed to push him further away from Polaris, rather than closer, and yet, he arrived at her desk exactly nineteen steps later. Her left eye opened, revealing a luminescent pink iris. She eyed Francis's distressed posture, the nervous expression on his face. The sweat was already rolling down his forehead. Whatever it was that Polaris seemed to possess, it was frightening Francis to his very core. **"I don't have all day, Francis."** She sighed, her eye slowly closing once more in disappointment and disinterest. \
*"I have.. a request for Project Angel, Polaris."* Francis promptly began, standing upright and clearing his throat before continuing, pushing up his glasses as he inhaled deeply. *"I'd like to make a formal amendment. I see a potential direction that the project may see better succes in as compared to where it stands now."* \
Polaris's left eye reopened, the pink, illuminating iris looking directly into Francis's very own blue eyes. **"Proceed."** \
*"..Right.. I believe the Flame Heart may see similar use to Project Gradient. Despite its age, Ultima hasn't experienced a falloff like Palmer-Eden once predicted. I believe it is worth it to expand the project into something in the same alleyway to Project Gradient, and move Project Angel to SOLARsec, and the military."* Francis continued, the nerves beginning to get to him, sweat dripping down from not just his forehead, but all the way to his chin. His hands were still behind his back, and he refused to make eye contact with Polaris, who was now eyeing the display on her left. \
**"2C, what went wrong with Project Gradient, again?"** \
*// An external intervention caused the subject to break free of their chains, effectively ending the project immediately. Putting Project Angel on the same rails might lead to the same end result as Project Gradient. //* 2C immediately replied, leaving Polaris's gaze travelling back to the nervous eyes of Francis. **"The subject escaped, and broke free of their chains."** She sighed. **"2C has a point, Francis. How will you prevent fate repeating itself?"** \
Francis cleared his throat once more, finally breaking his staredown with the coat of arms that was decorating the walls behind Polaris. Taking a deep breath, he stared directly into Polaris's only opened eye, the pink iris almost having a hypnotising effect on him. Nodding slowly, he opened his mouth, and began to defend his stance. *"Dr. Merrent has had a crucial psychological impact on Angel, and has played a role in the gradual returning of her memories from before the Flame Heart operation. I believe that removing Merrent from the equation will cause the memories to dwindle, especially if Angel is transported out of her comfort grounds."* \
**"Will this not cause distress, Francis?"** Polaris immediately interrupted him, gazing deeper and deeper into Francis's soul as her eye began to glimmer, pulsing slightly. **"Will it not cause Angel to disobey? You've created an independent researcher that commands the flames to her will. How certain are you she will not wield them against you?"** \
Francis remained quiet for a moment, seemingly lost deeply in thought. Polaris's question seemed to have caught him off guard, and yet, for the first time, the sweat had completely disappeared off his forehead. He stood cemented to the floor, absolutely certain and confident in his position in the project that he wanted to take to the next direction that he felt was right. *"A killswitch. We'll have her go under the knife once more. If she wields her flames against our own, it will be her last."* \
Polaris's right eye opened, revealing another luminescent iris, but unlike the one on her left, this one was almost fully white, being surrounded by a black ring, and a black pupil. It caused Francis to shiver. But even despite the riled up fear through his spine, Polaris smirked. **"Ridiculous, Francis!"** She laughed, her hands now held together. \
**"Make it so."** She smiled, almost grinning widely and maliciously. **"Make it so, Francis. You have my blessing."**
### Addendum
*"What's with her eyes?"* Polaris herself, too, is an internal experiment of SOLARdawn herself too. But being the head of research herself, she actively keeps her own identity out of the archives, and does so successfully. Through the various breaches that SOLARdawn has experienced in its history (Even though they can be counted on one hand, this *does* lead to *Hammerhead's HEART* gaining intel on the ongoing projects within SOLARdawn, prompting the rescue of Gradient and eventually Angel). \
According to the few number of people that have claimed to have "survived" a meeting with Polaris, her eyes have an almost hypnotic effect in them. Her left eye, which some simply refer to as "Magenta", is next to a neurotech eye also a biologically altered eye through the help of *Leremkov's* early experiments. Even so, Francis remains one of the only people to have seen Polaris's right eye, "White death", and have lived to tell the tale. *// I'm overthinking this LMAO I need to work this out properly another time I'm burnt out.*

 
## Project ANGEL
### Communication log between Angelina and Dave, monitored by Unit 4C - August 10th, 2074
*// LOG ENTRY INITIATED. This conversation is now being recorded by request of Director Mullan. //* \
**"Yeah, whatever, 4C, it won't change my stance whether you record it or not."** Angelina sighed. Before her was a packed folder with not just her own research papers, but a handful of verification papers that she had to go through as well. To her annoyance, she had already decided to pull the trigger on her own sacrifice for this project, and yet, one year after her incredibly tough decision had been made, she had still not moved a single metre forward. *"It's routine, sorry."* The man that was seated next to her said back, a slight hint of annoyance in his own voice as well. *"We'll start at the very top. Dr. Velana, have you read through the terms, conditions, and clauses cited in your papers, and those you have received from SOLARdawn's internal circuit?"* \
**"Twice per day, during lunch and before bedtime. And each and every time I've agreed. Dave, is this really necessary? My stance has remained unchanged since September."** Angelina immediately replied, sighing deeply and crossing her arms as her eyes veered back and forth between the papers, and the Unit that was recording the conversation. *"Let me phrase it differently."* Dave replied, placing the sheet of paper and his pen back on the table before turning his chair around to face Angelina directly. His expression betrayed him, a sense of worry and uncertainty was on full display for her to see. *"Angelina, you understand that if you go through with this, the person known as "Dr. Angelina Velana" will cease to exist, do you? Regardless of whether the project succeeds or fails, the person that you are right now, the person that I'm having this conversation with, will die."* He continued, taking pauses while speaking to find the correct words, a slight tremble in his voice. \
In response, Angelina glanced away from Dave, and instead took a hold of the stack of papers herself. Taking the pen, she skimmed through the seemingly endless list of verification checks, reading once more through all risks involved, the procedure that would take place, and the ultimate fate that she would face. And yet, she flew through the papers. Angelina knew exactly what not just Dave, but the rest of SOLARdawn was worried about, and even so, she scribbled her signature at the very bottom of each page, dropping the pen loudly on top of the table and resuming the stare into Dave's eyes. **"Does this answer you, Dave?"** She asked, her brows furrowing. \
*"I.. believe it does.."* He sighed back, his elbow resting on the table and his hand now pressing against his forehead. *"But, Angelina, even if you agree, I don't think Polaris would-"* \
**"Polaris has not once agreed with me, Dave, every paper that has the name "Velana" stamped on it is rejected!"** Angelina scoffed, almost snapping completely upon the mere mention of the name "Polaris". Holding her hand flat on the table, she did her best to hold back from lashing out any further, but taking a deep breath, she slowly continued. **"This project is separate from Polaris's wishes altogether. I could not care less what they have to say about it, it doesn't involve them in the slightest."** \
Dave was left shocked, and even if he would bring up what was on his mind, he knew that it would not help Angelina's case any further. As much as he hated to admit it, he wasn't able to convince her in the slightest about changing her stance, changing anything regarding the project she had been working on for over a year now. She was at the doorstep of finally starting Project Angel, something she had been dreaming of working towards, something she had envisioned from the very moment she first walked through the doors in Amadnésam almost a decade ago. \
*"I get it, forget that I mentioned Polaris altogether."* He said back in defeat, and taking a folder from the far end of the table, he handed it to Angelina. *"This is from a few decades ago, back when PALMER-EDEN was still in service in Illinois. 4C has analysed it and figured out that there have been no reported cases where Ultima and Leremkov have been mixed. It thinks it might hamper the project."* He continued, a worried smile appearing on his face while Angelina's eyes darted towards the small, orange box that was on top of the table on their opposing end. In its centre, it had a camera lens that was continuously recording the conversation between the two researchers, but 4C was capable of much, much more when connected to its main terminal in the research halls. But raising her eyebrow, Angelina didn't think too much of the robot's ideas about her project. **"Have the old man Vitaly come to my office as soon as possible. I know he's in Amadnésam right now, and if this really is the last weak link, I will have it fixed and start immediately."** She said, her eyes darting from the spinning camera lens towards Dave's eyes. But in a matter of seconds, she bundles up all her papers and left the signed checklist on the table, standing up from her chair and promptly leaving the room. With a deep sigh, Dave could only watch her leave and close the door shut tight behind her, and glancing to his right, he skimmed through the papers that Angelina had left behind. Each and every checkbox was marked on "Agree", only cementing her fate as the vessel for the project. Shaking his head, he stared at the papers in disbelief for a few moments, before glancing at the orange box, the worried smile remaining on his face. *"4C, stop the recording."* \
*// LOG ENTRY ENDED. The recording has been saved. Connect me to a terminal to view it. //*
#### Addendum
**Project Angel**, as designed by the namesake **Angelina Velana** herself, is a project that attempts to unlock humanity's full potential, combining the supernaturalism of the once prestigious **Ultima** project that dated back to **PALMER-EDEN**, and the ever developing possibilities that open up by **Vitaly Leremkov**'s ongoing research with mixing human DNA with animal DNA to reduce or outright remove any flaws within the human genome. \
Even with all risks assessed, it would still be an enormous challenge to have everything go smoothly during a single operation. As nobody was willing enough to become the vessel for the project, Angelina herself made the decision after searching and waiting for half a year, eventually stepping forward to become the recipient of a **Flame Heart**. (*// This is what allows Angel to ignite her spear at free will in [[KILLJOY - Story]], the shaft of the spear is a channel that prevents the spear itself from igniting and burning, channelling her ability to the tip alone.*) \
The operation alone is where things become more awry. The replacement of a heart, and the subsequent stress on the recipient's body from the further changes induced by Leremkov, tied together with being under anaesthetics for almost a day straight leaves them with a high risk of amnesia following the operation. This is what Dave implied with *"The person I'm having this conversation with will die"*, as the person that is Angelina will no longer exist following the operation. Under guidance of 4C, she is set to undergo rehabilitation and in the following months, learn to master her abilities and newfound strength, whoever that "Angel" might become.

### Communication log between Angelina and Dave, monitored by Unit 4C - August 17th, 2074
*// LOG ENTRY INITIATED. This conversation is now being recorded by request of Dr. Velana. //* \
With a quiet whirr, 4C's camera spun around once after it was placed on the table, monitoring the conversation that Angelina and Dave were to have right before the very start of Project Angel. Over the past week, Angelina had worked out the final details and flaws that 4C had picked up after analysing her papers, highlighting a potential weak link between the Ultima organ and the addition of Leremkov to her body in the same surgery. It believed that the immense stress that would take place on her body soon after a heart surgery would paralyse her altogether, but once more, Angelina presented a folder of simulated data that she had worked out with Dr. Leremkov, refuting 4C's analysis. After staring at the folder for a moment, Dave hesitantly picked it up from the table while Angelina was gazing deeply into his eyes. She had been waiting for well over a year for the project to kick off, even after having found a suitable vessel for the project: Herself. Slowly and carefully, he read through all eight pages word for word, holding a marker to point out any lines that he left him confused or where he wanted to ask Angelina about, but reaching the last page, the marker was left unused. Defeated, he drops the folder back to the table, and placed his hand on his forehead, struggling to process the reality of the situation. *"I.. take it there's no way for me to convince you otherwise?"* He asked, absentmindedly looking at Angelina's face. \
**"None at all."** She replied firmly, and looking to her left, she looked at 4C's display, imitating a film roll spinning as it continued to record the conversation that the two researchers were having. **"4C, you analysed the paper that Vitaly and I worked out. Did you find any flaws?"** \
*// Indeed, I have analysed your paper. Compared to the previously shared paper, the flaws that I had found on your paper regarding Leremkov have been explored further, and I have not found any remaining flaws requiring attention. I am not authorised to, but were I able to, I would grant this project a green light. //* \
A smile appeared on Angelina's face, as her eyes darted back to Dave's worried face, who seemed to be deeply lost in thought. **See? Even 4C agrees. The rehab process is laid out for the first year onwards, the Flame Heart is ready, and Vitaly is ready for his part of the operation too. Philippe will monitor me closely for the first month, too. Dave, why are you holding me back still?** \
*"It doesn't sit easy with me, Angelina. This is essentially the last time we'll talk. The very next time I will.. have a conversation with you.. you will not be the Angelina that I've known for the past ten years."* Dave sighed, burying his face in his hands after finishing with speaking, struggling emotionally to deal with the reality of watching someone willingly step forward into their imminent death. Even if it was for research, it didn't sit easy with him that the prestigious researcher, Dr. Angelina Velana, would offer herself for this project that wasn't even guaranteed to be a success. *"Did it.. really have to be you to be the vessel?"* \
**"Nobody else was willing, and I've searched day and night for half a year."** Angelina scoffed, her brows furrowing now that Dave was returning to the topic of the conversation from just over a week ago. **"Dave, nothing is going to change my mind. If you have nothing notable worth saying anymore, I'll go and check in with Francis for the planning for the operation."** She continued, already beginning to scramble together her papers while constantly keeping an eye on 4C's rolling camera. With a lump in his throat, Dave wasn't able to respond, struggling to find the words, or a single word at all for that matter. Instead, he could only nod slowly, watching his long-term colleague step up from her chair with papers and folders in hand. \
**"Dave."** She began, a feint smile appearing on her face as the two locked eyes for one last time. **"4C, end the recording in 10 seconds. Dave, I'm sorry."** She said, her feint smile quickly being exchanged with a face of worry of her own, before she turned around to face the door of the room that they were in. **"The odds are low, but never zero. I hope my amnesia won't be as severe as expected, I.. hope I'll remember-"** \
*// LOG ENTRY ENDED. The recording has been saved. Connect me to a terminal to view it. //*

### Interaction log between Dave and 4C, generated by Unit 4C - October 2nd, 2074
With a deep, deflated sigh, Dave made his way towards a Terminal in the western wing of the SOLARdawn campus. It wasn't for much longer that he'd be walking through these halls, especially since the research division which he worked in would be moved towards the old Alexandrie campus and research site. But even if it was his last week here, the lunch break he was on right now allowed him to make his way here, and with his heart pounding loudly in his chest, he rested his finger on the biometric fingerprint reader. Keeping a close eye on the Terminal's display, a bar slowly filled as it analysed Dave's biometric data, before a chime alerted him that he had been successfully logged in. To his relief, 4C was currently connected to the Terminal. \
*// Biometric data point detected. Analysing... //* \
*// Verification successful. Welcome, Dr. Dave Mullan, to Terminal GWW-7. If you have any questions, feel free to ask me. I will assist you in whatever fashion possible. Your schedule for today is empty. How may I help you? //* \
Taking a deep breath, Dave continued to stare at the empty schedule before him. Just a month ago, it was packed to the brim with meetings, papers to verify, and research to conduct together with researchers from Alexandrie regarding a flu breakout on Léjtis. But from this week onwards, his schedule would only be available at Terminals within the Alexandrie campus, meaning he was no longer working under SOLARdawn. \
**"4C, please show me the status of Project Angel."** He asked to the Terminal, and in an immediate fashion, a spinning icon on the display informed Dave that 4C was beginning to harvest the data he needed. Even if it had already been over a month, the lack of communication from Project Angel was essentially gone from the very moment Angelina entered the operation room in late August. She had been Dave's only contact regarding the project, and lacking the authorisations to look into it on his own accord, the radio silence had been eating away at him from inside out. \
*// Looking for informative logs related to Project Angel. Please wait a moment while I fetch the data... //* \
*// Fetch successful. Please perform a biometric authentication once more to verify your authorisation level. //* \
Dave felt his heart sink. The thing he was most worried about now seemed to unfold right before his eyes. He couldn't blame 4C for it, nor could he blame himself, or anyone, for simply not being involved directly in the project. With his eyes closed, he took another deep breath, and placed his finger on the biometric reader once more, holding his breath while expecting the worst. \
*// Biometric data point detected. Analysing... Verifying... //* \
*// Verification successful. Authorisation level matched. By request of Dr. Angelina Velana, you can now view the contents of Project Angel. Where would you like to start, Dr. Dave Mullan? //* \
Expecting to be dissappointed, Dave instead opened his eyes wide upon hearing the name Angelina, staring at the monitor in surprise now that it displayed many folders, many activity logs, and all the papers that led up to the research as a whole. Expecting to see nothing, instead, he now could see everything. **"Angelina.."** He whispered to himself, still in disbelief, but now hopeful that he could at least find answers now that he could view everything related to Project Angel. **"4C, it's a lot to take in for me. Can you summarise the project from August until now?"** He asked the brain powering the terminal. Even despite its size, it was capable of processing and handling data much faster than any human has ever been able to. And within a moment it complied, not just fetching and analysing the data in under a second, but presenting it to Dave immediately after. \
*// Fetching and analysing data... Please wait a moment while I summarise it... //* \
*// Summary completed. On August 23rd, 2074, the vessel, from hereon referred to as "Angel", has received the Flame Heart Ultima organ in SR-E1. This operation was carried out by Dr. Francis Ezarea. On August 23rd, 2074, Angel has received an altered genome, this operation has been carried out by Dr. Vitaly Leremkov. On August 24th, 2074, Angel has woken up in RH-E1. Please note: The data between the operation and today is fairly limited. Would you like me to highlight details that might interest you? //* \
With a look of worry on his face and in his eyes, Dave could only nod into the camera on top of the display. It would function as 4C's eye while it was connected to the terminal, but it would be enough for it to recognise Dave's gesture. \
*// Understood. Analysing... //* \
*// I have found a report from Dr. Ezarea, made on September 14th, 2074. Dr. Ezarea describes that Angel is suffering severe amnesia, and is struggling to adapt to what is going on, having no recollection of her past. Even despite this, she is adapting well physically, and has completed the first test with her Flame Heart successfully. Additionally, Dr. Velana herself has given Angel a guidebook on how to go through rehab properly, which should accelerate her recovery over time. //* \
*// Unfortunately, there are no further reports or logs that mention anything different than what I have just presented. What more can I help you with? //* \
Exhaling deeply, Dave began to feel lifeless staring at the monitor. Even despite Angelina's hopefulness that her amnesia wouldn't be as severe as she expected, it had remained nothing but hope. Following the operation, she had still lost her memories completely, and just like Dave had feared, Angelina Velana, his long-time friend and colleague, was effectively dead. But even so, Dave remained hopeful, and refused to let that waving fire within him dwindle and fade. He was beginning to run out of time, and had to make his way back to his own wing too, his lunch break was almost over. Taking a deep breath, he built up the courage one last time to ask 4C a question, expecting to receive the worst, but hopeful to receive a good answer. \
**"4C.."** He began, his voice beginning to tremble slightly. He hadn't seen Angelina in over a month, in fact, the last time he had spoken with her was just a few days before she went under the knife. Her voice continued to echo through his head, only making him worry more, only leaving more doubts in his mind. **"Is.. is there a possibility for me to see her?"** \
The display showed a loading circle once more, but this time around, it took much longer than what 4C usually needed to process a request. It was spinning for at least ten seconds, which was already 20 times longer than usual. It didn't ease up Dave's nerves at all, and holding his breath, the circle faded, and 4C answered. \
*// I'm sorry, at this moment, visitors during Angel's rehabilitation period are not possible. However, I will keep this request in my memory and message you as soon as a spot becomes available. //* \
A deflated smile appeared on Dave's face, and checking his watch once more, he had run out of time to ask 4C any further questions. But before he stepped away from the terminal, another sudden question came up in his mind. **"4C, I'm leaving for Alexandrie next week, which means I'll no longer be registered under SOLARdawn."** He remarked, the realisation settling in that this might be the very last time he would be seeing 4C, or even be allowed to look into Project Angel's files. **"Will I.. keep access?"** \
*// Correct. Your biometric data, and the profile attached to it, will not change even when out of office. //* \
Dave's smile became more genuine, and even if his worries for Angelina remained circling in his head, he at least felt more at ease knowing that she was going through rehab fine, knowing that he'd at least be able to see her again. Even if it would be a long while away, he knew that he wasn't staring at a closed door. **"Thank you, 4C."** He smiled, pressing his finger against the biometric reader once more, before stepping away from the Terminal. Even with how much he hated the thought of it, he would need to keep these worries away from his mind in the foreseeable future. But it'd be worth it in the end, is what he'd keep telling himself. As long as he'd remember, he knew that Angelina, wherever she was right now, would remember too. \
*// You are most welcome, Dr. Dave Mullan. //* \
*// Biometric data point detected. Analysing... //* \
*// Verification successful. You have been logged out, Dr. Dave Mullan. //*

### Project Angel progress report, written by Philippe Merrent - January 31st, 2074
*// Unless you are authorised to view the contents of Project ANGEL, please read no further than this line. //*

This report is part of Project ANGEL, and falls under the reports made during **January 2025**. Please store the report accordingly, to prevent a potential loss of data and history.

As aforementioned in December, we have started to see signs of discolouration on Angel's **right wrist**. Her originally white skin had discoloured into a mixture of red and turquoise, the latter matching her eye colours almost identically. We believe that this is caused by excessive usage of her **Flame Heart**, and accordingly, we have scaled down the tests we have been running over the last two months with an elevated monitoring of her heart, blood pressure, and various other vital data that is available in this report too. Crucially, this means that the project is slowing down once more, much like it has struggled to come into motion, too. 

The effects, and the discolouration of her skin, seems to intensify during the usage of her **Flame Heart**. The specific use case is not relevant, as we have noticed this regardless of its usage, be it heat generation, or simple check-ups. However, the discolouration remains when used for longer periods of time, and while routinely taking about 90 minutes to fade and return to her normal skin colour, more intensive tests can not only increase the duration of the discolouration up to 360 minutes, but also spreads further away from her wrist. The most extreme case we have encountered so far has been during a concurrent heating test on January 17th, where Angel had aided a research team in the Southern Wing of the Amadnésam campus in their simulations and practical testing of heat-resistant technologies. In this test, her **Flame Heart** did not encounter a single measured issue, however, Angel did mention feeling "extremely exhausted and depleted" following the conclusion of her participation in the simulations. In this specific case, the discolouration on her arm had spread from her wrist towards her fingertips, as well as nearly covering her entire lower arm. Despite the risk we believe it carries, it also have us a more intricate look at the patterns that emerged on her arm within the discolouration, and a symmetric and sharp pattern appears. Her skin colour had changed from her normal white into a fiery red, with turquoise colours seeping in through rhombus-like patterns. Our findings on this are unfortunately nothing more than this, though, and as of writing, we have not managed to find a reason that this pattern appears, other than it having a potential link to the Ultima organ.

Following this analysis, we will begin experimenting with various types of **staffs**, that we strongly believe will help Angel channel the powers that her **Flame Heart** gives her through a different object. We would much rather have to go through hundreds of iterated types of staffs, than have Angel lose her arm, with the turning point being either the explanation of what the discolouration on her wrist truly means, and assessing its risks or benefits that it may bring, or until we find and create a staff that will not incinerate after a certain number of uses. We will begin trialling various means of Angel channelling her powers through a spear throughout February, so please keep an eye out on the February report by that time.

However, with the discolouration of Angel's wrist during the channelling of her **Flame Heart** power aside, we are very positive with the results and health progress that we have been seeing so far! We are nearly reaching the tipping point as Angelina described, and halfway through February, we will perform a 6-month test on her blood and assess its data, and comparing it to the data that we retained from before the operation commenced, and soon after Angel had woken up from the surgery in August. Time has been flying by for not just Angel, but also for myself and Francis, and we believe that the one-year mark should allow Angel to have recovered a good portion of her memories as well, especially since she has remarked that the *déjà vu moments* have been disappearing as well, instead being exchanged for properly describable memories, as she says herself. This too, we will be monitoring closely as February and August 2075 will approach. Until then, our research continues as normal. 

If this report has left you with any questions, please contact **Dr. P. Merrent**, or **Dr. F. Ezarea**.

### Project Angel update, written by Francis Ezarea - August 28th, 2075
*// Unless you are authorised to view the contents of Project ANGEL, please read no further than this line. //*

Announcement of the relocation of Project Angel to Myrdiva.

To everyone involved in Project Angel, including Angel herself. Starting **September 1st**, the project, as well as Angel herself, will be relocated to the SOLARdawn division located in **Myrdiva**. Following a struggle in development after the *6-month turning point*, we have come to the conclusion that the Amadnésam Campus may simply not be the right location to further evolve the project. While we are more than please to see Angel's recovery over the past year, including her flourishing usage and mastery of her **Flame Heart**, and the areas in which it has been utilised the past five months, we believe that we have unfortunately hit a roadblock in how far we are able to leap Project Angel forward. As a means of attempting to further extend the project into the far future, the decision to have Angel relocated to the **Myrdiva** division is now final. 

While Angel has been steadily improving over the course of the last twelve months, we are confident that her upwards curve will not reach an end, or stagnate, after her transfer to Myrdiva. In fact, with continued usage of her Flame Heart, we believe that it may actually be more beneficial to her in not just the discovery and practice of her newly found Ultima powers, but also to allowing her memory to return as time progresses. In the recent months, we have iterated Angel's so-called "Flame Staff" countless times, and we believe that we have finally found the right materials to use for the most durable staff possible, allowing the side-effects of her Flame Heart to be extremely minimal. More detail is yet to follow and will soon reach the channels of those involved in Myrdiva, however, it is planned that Angel will aid SOLARsec in the management and generation of power for the upkeep of the Myrdiva campus. Again, more information will be sent out in the coming days.
