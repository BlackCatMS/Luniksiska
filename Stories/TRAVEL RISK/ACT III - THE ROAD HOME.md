# THE ROAD HOME
Follows up and expands the **Addendum** in [[ACT II - ÁLEF AFTER SUNDOWN]]. Divided up into:
- **Ground Zero**/**The Road Home**: Maria makes her way towards the central station by foot, fully aware of all risks involved if she'd get spotted at this very moment. The emotions that are continuously building up from the loss of Raléi eat away her thoughts.
- **Breathe In**: Arriving in Ákros, despite all the risks that come with it, Maria meets up with Omáti and Nils for one last time, informing them about the gruesome fate that happened in Nórem, and tells them her current plan to flee back to her home nation of Jóthul. She makes the promise with both of them to meet them again soon when they're all in a better shape and peace of mind again, but upon her departure from the hospital, she already knows that it's a promise she can't keep. (Omáti was essentially at death's door by this time, aiding and supervising Nils's recovery at the cost of his own health.)
- **And Out**: Arriving home, the floodgates open and her emotions wreak havoc on her mind. 
- **Wishes Granted**: Maria, a few weeks after the fateful day in Álef, makes her way to Zhuehai joining forces with the Hammerhead Research Team and gets a proper involvement in the future of space technology. Stepping through the planetarium-in-construction in Shánzhe, her eyes immediately fixate onto the nearby star of **Messier-48**, which Raléi had named **"Cintura"**. It would be the first of many wishes from Raléi that she would fulfill after her death.
