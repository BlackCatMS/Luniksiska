# HOPE
## VESSEL
**August 10th, 2074** | **SOLARdawn Campus, Amadnésam** \
**Angelina Velana**, **Dave Mullan**
### Project Angel
"**Project Angel**" was its name. The ambitious and possibly groundbreaking project directed and led by the prestigious **Angelina Velana**. It had already been ten full years since she first walked through the doors of **SOLARdawn** in Amadnésam, with a smile from ear to ear, and a passion to become not just a staple, but a footing in the history of their development. With a short, but impactful history in the pharmaceutical industry, the spots opened up for her within SOLARdawn almost immediately, and before she even knew it, she had already been working there for over five whole years. But those years were filled to the brim with important research that she played part in. Across Amadnésam, the once-rivalling **Alexandrie Pharmaceuticals** found themselves in heavy weather, a scandal that had arisen between the insurance industry of **Jákovy** had led them trailing off a cliff, and they were ultimately forced to close their doors. But while theirs closed, SOLARdawn's opened, giving Angelina more room to develop herself in, and the projects that she was gradually becoming more and more of an important asset in. 

Her increasing importance and skill levels allowed more doors to open for her, leading further down the "grim" hallways of SOLARdawn and its more unethical research. After all, SOLARdawn was nothing more than the spiritual successor of what once was Palmer-Eden on Earth, and when they had been apprehended and kept under surveillance permanently after the escalated conflict in 2062, SOLARdawn was born, and the projects continued. And with the doors wide open, they were now for Angelina to see. She had gone through the remains of the Ultima project, once the pulse of Palmer-Eden that kept its ever-growing control over the US alive and well, but also the more recent projects. Within the archives, her eyes landed on Project Takeover, Project VIOLET, Project GRADIENT, the list seemed to continue almost endlessly. Whatever it had been that Palmer-Eden was once flourishing in behind closed doors, it seemed that their research had never reached an end. And now that Angelina was managing these projects, an itch began to grow in her mind. An itch to place a project on her own in these very archives, a consistent itch, a craving for more. While Dr. Leremkov was free to research and experiment on the human genome, mixing and matching DNA strains to create the "perfect being", Angelina herself felt limited in not her capabilities, but the ceiling that she was given to work within. But she refused to let that stop her, and in **2073**, the ball began to roll, and the project that she had dreamed to lead and conduct finally began to take shape. "**Project Angel**", was its name. 

The doors didn't open for her as soon as she laid her project on the table, however. It was an incredibly ambitious project, but also one that was extremely risky. Not only did it take pages out of the books from the decades-old Ultima project, so did it work hand-in-hand with Dr. Leremkov's DNA project. On paper, Angelina would create a person that would be not just powerful in theory, but could provide an incredible headstart within the research going on within SOLARdawn. Despite her ambitions, the risk was simply too high for her to immediately fire off all cylinders, and she was asked to scale down the project to at least assess whether it was worth it to keep around for in the future. If it were a success, it would only pave the way for her project, her dream, to flourish further into the future. \
But the project required one vital component to truly flourish: A person willing enough to sacrifice themselves to become the recipient of the Ultima organ, and the altered genome supplied by Dr. Leremkov. A person willing enough to become the vessel of the project. Day in, and day out, Angelina would go out of her way to ask every single person that walked through the halls of the Amadnésam Campus, handing out flyers, creating a survey through the internal communication channels. And yet, after six full months of trying, it was to no avail. In the end, only one option remained: Angelina would become the vessel of **Project Angel** herself.

Gently and carefully, the man placed a delicately textured orange box on the table that was littered with research papers. They were scattered all over the place, and it seemed like any sort of direction had been lost over time. The table wasn't dusty, but rather messy and unorganised, and it did appear as if someone had been using the table until as early as this morning. The man was no other than **Dave Mullan**, a long-time colleague, and a close friend of Angelina, who had been talking and discussing the direction of Project Angel for weeks on end. The two refused to agree with one another, and Dave himself especially abhorred the idea of Angelina sacrificing herself to take a risk as big as the one she was set to take within a month. The papers that she had written regarding the research for Project Angel weren't flawed, in fact, they were almost spotless. Even the so-called "Elite" struggled to find any issues with the papers that Angelina had written, and were certain that the project would receive a go-ahead from whoever was managing her. Deflated, Dave sat down, and averting his eyes from Angelina sitting before him, he looked at the orange box that now stood to his right on the far end of the table. *"4C, please make a recording of this conversation."* He said to the box, and within a second, its control panel lit up in a dim green colour, and the camera whirred. If the box could nod in agreement, it would've, but the camera whirr alone told the two enough about the atmosphere that was looming in the room. Angelina's face was filled with annoyance, and looking at the roll of film on the small display spinning, indicating its recording status, she sighed. **"Yeah, whatever, 4C, it won't change my stance whether you record it or not."** \
*"It's routine, sorry"* Dave replied, a slight hint of annoyance in his own voice as well. Even if he had done his best to convince Angelina otherwise about her decision to sacrifice herself to become the vessel for Project Angel, it still didn't sit right with him. But neither did it feel right to Angelina herself either. It had already been one year since she made the hardest decision of her life, effectively deciding to end it prematurely just to become the recipient of the Ultima organ, and yet, she had not moved a single metre forward since. Clearing his throat, Dave scraped together a series of papers stamped with SOLARdawn's logo at the top left. Even if he struggled to do so, he took a glance at 4C to his right, before looking Angelina directly in her eyes while reading off the first paper. *"We'll start at the very top. Dr. Velana, have you read through the terms, conditions, and clauses cited in your papers, and those you have received from SOLARdawn's internal circuit?"* \
**"Twice per day, during lunch and before bedtime. And each and every time I've agreed. Dave, is this really necessary? My stance has remained unchanged since September."** Angelina immediately replied, giving Dave no room to breathe or even process his own question that he had just read out loud. Crossing her arms, she sighed deeply, her eyes veering back and forth between the papers held in Dave's hands, and Unit 4C, which was still recording their conversation. *"Let me phrase it differently.* Dave replied, having collected his words. Placing the sheets of papers and his pen back on the table, he looked Angelina directly into her eyes once more. His own expression betrayed him, however, a sense of worry and uncertainty on full display for her to see. *"Angelina, you understand that, if you go through with this, the person known as "Angelina Velana", will cease to exist, do you? Regardless of whether the project succeeds or fails, the person that you are right now, the person that I'm having this conversation with, will die."* He continued, his voice trembling slightly as he took various pauses between his words, struggling to find the correct words. \
In response, Angelina's own expression remained unchanged, and shying away from Dave, she instead took a hold of the sheets of verification papers that Dave had placed back on the table herself. Taking the pen, she skimmed through the seemingly endless list of verification checks, reading once more through the risks that were involved, the procedures that the project would be executed through, and the ultimate fate that she would face. And yet, she flew through the papers. The questions were the exact same as the ones she had read on the daily while waiting for the green light to flicker on, waiting for the doors for the projects to open, waiting for the inevitable day of her sacrifice. Angelina was fully aware of what not just Dave, but the rest of the staff and researchers at SOLARdawn were worried about, and yet, at the very bottom of each and every single page, she scribbled her signature. Finishing the twelfth and last page, she dropped the pen loudly on the table, pushing the stack of papers back towards Dave as their eyes met yet again. **"Does this answer you, Dave?"** She asked, her brows furrowing. *"I.. believe it does.."* He could only sigh back. His elbow was anchored on the table, his hand pressing against his forehead as he continued to stare at the signature at the very bottom of the page. His heart began to sting, his mind began to sting, before his eyes, it was all beginning to unfold. *"But, Angelina, even if you agree, I don't think Polaris would-"* \
**"Polaris has not once agreed with me, Dave, every paper that has the name "Velana" stamped on it is rejected!"** Angelina immediately scoffed back, the mere mention of the name "Polaris" already seemingly pushing her over the edge. Her hand was rested flat on the table, she had stood up from her chair out of anger, but did her best to stay calm and hold back from lashing out any further at her colleague. Taking a deep breath, she recomposed herself, and after exhaling deeply through her mouth, she continued. **"This project is separate from Polaris's wishes altogether. I could not care less what they have to say about it, it doesn't involve them in the slightest."** 

Dave was left shocked, and even if he were to bring up what was circling through his mind, he knew that it would not help Angelina's case any further. As much as he hated to admit it to himself, he wasn't able to convince her in the slightest about changing her stance, or changing anything regarding the project for that matter. She had been working full-time on Project Angel for over a year now, and right now, she was at the very doorstep of finally breaking through, finally stepping through what seemed to be an impenetrable wall in her research, finally being able to start the project that she had dreamed of every day, something she had envisioned from the very moment she had first walked through the doors of the Amadnésam campus almost a decade ago. Dave could only sigh in defeat, even he was unable to convince her to change her mind, he didn't want to end their last weeks together with bad blood between the two either. *"I get it, forget that I mentioned Polaris altogether."* He said, his hand pressing against his forehead once more as his other took a folder from the far end of the table, handing it over to Angelina. *"This is from a few decades ago, back when PALMER-EDEN was still in service in Illinois."* He continued, his hands returning to rest in his lap once more. *"4C has analysed it and figured out that there have been no reported cases where Ultima and Leremkov have been mixed. It thinks it might hamper the project."* He finished, a worried smile appearing on his face while Angelina's eyes darted to the small, orange box that was still in the same spot at the opposing end of the table. In its centre, it had a camera lens the size of half its body, which was still continuously recording the conversation between the two researchers. Despite its looks and size, 4C was capable of much, much more when connected to a main terminal in one of the research halls. But raising her eyebrow, Angelina didn't think too much of the little robot's ideas regarding her project, and her eyes were quick to dart back to Dave's worries expression, away from the spinning camera. **"Have the old man Vitaly come into my office as soon as possible. I know he's in Amadnésam right now, and if this really is the last weak link, I will have it fixed and start immediately."** She said, her voice firm and direct. Her eyes were glimmering, and as if time froze, Dave could see the burning passion that hid within her eyes brighter than ever. But it didn't take long before the two broke their short-lasted stare, and Angelina quickly bundled up all the papers from the table and left only the signed verification papers on the table for Dave to bring to the project supervisor. Stepping up from her chair, Dave could only watch Angelina leave out of the room, shutting the door tightly behind her. On the now-empty table, he looked at the twelve papers that Angelina had left behind, and peeking through each and every single sheet, every checkbox appeared to be marked with "Agree", only cementing her fate as the vessel for Project Angel. He shook his head, and his hand travelled to his mouth in disbelief, his eyes remaining fixated on the signature at the bottom of each page. He stood there, lost in thought, for what felt like forever, but snapping back to his senses, he looked at the small orange box on the opposing end of the table. Looking into its rolling camera, the worried smile remained on his face the longer he stared straight ahead, slowly but surely catching himself falling back into his thoughts, drifting off into the distance while standing still. Memories began to float through his head, reminding him of all the research he had conducted with Angelina by his side, every hour, minute, second spent with her. The realisation now began to fully dawn upon him, and taking a deep breath to keep his mind at ease, he focused back on the orange box before him. *"4C, stop the recording."* He said, and immediately, a green light appeared on its small display. *// The recording has been saved. //* It chimed back happily, finally causing Dave to smile with less worries. No matter where Project Angel would bring Angelina, he was certain that each and every memory, be it good or bad, would never be forgotten by him.

# ANGEL
## BLACKOUT
**August 24th, 2074** | **SOLARdawn Medical Centre, Amadnésam** \
**Angel**
### Hello, Angel
**Rough**: Following the operation, **Angel** wakes up in the Medical Centre under supervision of **Dr. Philippe Merrent**. Despite Angelina's hopefulness about the amnesia being not as bad as expected, it has indeed essentially given Angel a clean sheet. She doesn't know where she is, or what happened before she woke up. She mentions the lack of dreams, but odd, scattered memories that she couldn't pinpoint exactly. To Philippe, however, this result was expected, and gradually, Angel slowly adjusts to herself, adjusting to her memory loss.
## TARGET ACQUIRED
**July 10th, 2076** | **Myddliva** \
**Nova**
### A friend in need
**Rough**: The plan appeared to be simple. **Sierra**, originally Nova's contractor at **Vátnelári**, has allowed Nils and Nova an opportunity at a way to get intel on a person of interest. While Nils is reluctant on eliminating a target instead of just harvesting data through hacking or netrunning, Nova's fingers itch to rest her hand on a trigger once more, and she sets off to **Myddliva**, where **Sierra** has figured out a route that their target might be at. 
### Dirty Hands
Extracts the previously written [Nevo x Nova spinoff](https://discord.com/channels/631018100707295232/631394778776469514/1275910854725992458). However, this will need to be transcribed back into text and properly adjusted. \
**Rough**: **Sierra**'s target is revealed to be **Nevo**, an artificially created swordsman with inhuman reaction speeds. (*// The link is most likely to be that Nevo, too, is created by SOLARdawn through "Project NERVE". His sword is connected to his nervous system through his wrist, allowing him to interact with them with incredible speeds.*) Lining up, and taking the shot, she can only watch her target deflect the bullet and disappear out of sight in a flash. Trying to flee, Nevo is already awaiting her at the door on the roof, interrogating her. (*// Rough: Does Nevo reveal his identity, or will he stay a mystery to Nova? Most likely: Nevo will tell his name and origin, revealing to Nova (And thus Nils) that the two have come in contact with SOLARdawn. Written in spinoff: "Don't try going after me again if you know what's good for you." This should be a first warning to Nova and Nils to keep their hands out of SOLARdawn's projects, but considering KILLJOY is yet to take place, they will not heed this warning.*)
## AMEND
**August 23rd, 2075** | **SOLARdawn Campus, Amadnésam** \
**Angel**
### A Burning Heart
**Rough**: During her rehabilitation period, **Angel** returns to the work that **Angelina** once did to pick the ropes back up according to Angelina's **own planning**. With a focus on power generation and research that require *excessive heat generation*, Angel's **Flame Heart** finds excellent usage and slowly but surely, her memories appear to be returning one at a time. 
### Sorry, Angelina
**Dr. Francis Ezarea**, the doctor that carried out the **Flame Heart transplant** exactly one year ago on this day, saw more than just research potential within **Angel**, and in agreement with Angel (*// Who is unbeknownst to what Francis is planning to do with her*) decided to change her original staff (*// Rough: The staff helps keep the Flame Heart stable and its power low, meaning it can't lost control and risk burning the campus down*) into a weapon: An intricately designed spear. Angel herself has never read the procedures that Angelina had laid out for her for her rehab period, and simply followed whatever it was that Francis would tell her. If he steered her into the direction of becoming more akin to a *weapon* rather than a prestigious *researcher*, Angel herself would believe it was the right thing to do so, because she didn't know any better. This malicious idea remained circling in Francis's mind for over a month already, but on **August 23rd**, Angel is displaced into **SOLARsec Myrdiva**, joining the likes of the **SOLARsec Elite**, and slowly but surely, the spear begins to bleed red.
## THE DEEP END
**September 19th** | **Amadnésam** \
**Nils Lorieux**, **Nova** 
### Deep pockets, deep secrets
**Rough**: **Nils** and **Nova** receive a tip from **Sierra**, who has been a major helping hand in giving opportunities and missions to the dream duo. Having found a point of interest that might be vital to finding information that would sell for incredible prices on the black market, Nils and Nova set off to an abandoned research tower in **Amadnésam**. To their surprise, they don't find anyone guarding the place, even heeding Sierra's warnings. Unbeknownst to them, after finding documents directly related to **SOLARdawn**'s ongoing **4C** and **VIOLET** projects, they trip a silent alarm that immediately informs **SOLARsec** about the intrusion of their (What was believed to be) abandoned research tower. It doesn't take long before Nils and Nova make their way out of the tower, but to their surprise, are met with force.
### Hindsight
In hindsight, Nils knows that it would've been better for the two of them to stay out of dangerous missions after **Nevo**'s warning to **Nova** a few months prior. Even so, the two continued diving deeper into the unknown, and while Nova was able to escape, Nils is detained and carried away to **Myrdiva**, where his fate is decided by **Angel**.

# REMEMBER
## HEART SEEKER
**September 22nd** | **SOLARdawn Campus, Amadnésam** \
**Dave Mullan**
### Amended, the vessel
Originally having departed for **Alexandrie**, his work there has been completed, and he is back to working on his previous projects within **SOLARdawn**. Returning to the Amadnésam Campus gives him the opportunity to look into the progress for **Project Angel**, but to his horror, after connecting to a terminal and asking 4C, he learns about the direction that **Francis Ezarea** has taken the project in. From a positive line upwards, and Angel's memory returning bit by bit, it now seemed completely lost, the project having changed to reduce her to merely a killing machine.
### Heart Seeker
Dave isn't left without hope, though. The fact that **Angelina**'s memory was returning at all told him enough, and he sets off without a second thought, understanding all risks and dangers involved, to find Angel, wherever she may be, to attempt to make her remember, even if it would cost him his life.
## A DANCE OF FIRE AND ICE
**September 24th** | **SOLARsec, division Myrdiva** \
**Nova**
### Vengeance Fixation
With eyes burning brightly with revenge on **Nils** giving her tunnelvision, **Nova** returns once more to **Myrdiva** to enact revenge on **Angel**. Even if it was for a good cause, Nova herself is fully aware that her close-combat skills are nowhere near as good as those of Angel, and in good hope that she'd manage to fend off Angel well enough with just her dagger, it doesn't take long before she is injured by Angel, and is forced to throw in the towel. (*// Obviously, Angel still keeps her promise of executing Nova "Slowly and painfully", like she had told her before her sudden departure to Amadnésam earlier in the week. While this is still relatively underdeveloped, it is not a key point in the story per se, meaning it will be worked out more properly later on.*)
## REMEMBER
**Rough**: **"Remember"**: Following **KILLJOY** and during **HEAVY RAINFALL WARNING**, Dave makes his way to Amadnésam, closely following 4C's directions and data points to lead him directly to Angel. Frozen in place and frozen in time in the halls of the SOLARdawn campus once more, Dave finds Angel escorted by various SOLARsec guards, but to both of their surprise, their eyes meet, and Angel stands still in place. To her own surprise, she recognised Dave's face, but struggled to connect the dots, to figure out *why* it was that he was so familiar to her. Trying to approach her, Dave finds himself held at gunpoint by the escorting guards, until Angel steps out of the escort, gesturing the guards to lower their weapons. *// Obviously, more details than this are necessary, but that's why it's the finale. It's subject to change, but food for thought.*

### Rough snippet (Subtitle: "Remember?")
*// Pre: After days and days of walking between Myrdiva and Amadnésam, Dave finally received a clear lead from 4C about Angel's whereabouts, and her planning. In the halls of Campus Amadnésam, Dave finds Angel escorted by various SOLARsec guards.*

To her own surprise, Angel seemed to recognise the man's face that was gazing at her from the distance. Between the matte-black helmets and suits of the Elite guards that had circled around her, his face stood out through the crowd. Even if there were only five people to her right, his face still was the brightest one out of the bunch, and their eyes had already locked for at least ten seconds. *"Angel, we must proceed."* The guard to her left instructed her, but while Angel was usually immediate to comply, something about this man was compelling to her. *Why* was he so familiar? Following Angel's gaze, the rest of the guards followed it, and recognised Dave standing on the opposing end of the hallway. Without a second thought, their weapons were now suddenly raised and trained on the man's face and chest, which dispersed the rest of the people standing in their direction, but not Dave. His feet were cemented into the floor, and his gaze was ever burning into Angel's eyes. Despite her new appearance, and despite her new clothing, even despite the total lack of memories from her previous life as Angelina Velana, Dave remained steadfast, and remained confident. Confident that she'd remember him, confident that even through all the supposed bloodshed that was documented, she'd spare him, she'd remember him. *"You have a weapon. Drop it."* The guard closest to Dave instructed him. His voice was slightly robotic, altered and distorted through the LED mask he was wearing, and the red light waved as he spoke. At least twenty metres separated the two, but without a second thought, Dave, put his hand in his pocket, and dropped the razor knife that he had on his body to the floor, raising his hands afterwards. He remained silent, and his eyes remained fixated on Angel. He wasn't going to give up, not now, nor would he ever. His eyes drifted away from Angel's face, now focusing on the spear that she had been holding. Just like 4C had described, it was an intricately designed shaft, decorated by not just a luxurious spearhead, but also by many sorts of charms. His heart was beating furiously in his chest, and his mind was beginning to tell him to turn around, and forget this had ever happened. To forget Angelina, as she wouldn't remember a single thing anyway. The stained blood on the spearhead would only give him more reasons to stay away, and not take any further risks. But now that he was this close, he wasn't going to take a single step back anymore. 

Taking a single step forwards, he felt his heart skip a beat as the guards adjusted their trained rifles once more. The other researchers and students that had been walking through the hallway were now standing still, only able to witness the situation unfold before their very eyes. It seemed like a ridiculous decision for a regular person to take. An escort of Elite SOLARsec guards, armed and ready to empty a magazine into anyone that would even dare step close to them, harmful intent or not. They were surrounding and escorting not just any person, they were escorting *Angel*, SOLARsec's most feared executioner. Nightmares featured her, gossip and rumours about her were spreading through the halls like wildfire, and now that she was standing in the midst of these guards, it would be a guaranteed deathwish to even *think* about approaching her. *"Not a step closer!"* The guard at the very front instructed Dave, his voice raised after Dave's third step forward. *"This is your last warning. We do not play games!"* \
Dave complied, and stood still, his eyes still fixated on those of Angel. In her eyes, he could recognise a strange glimmer, one that he vividly remembered seeing in Angelina's own eyes every time she mentioned her dreams to him, the desire to complete a project of her own, the childhood dream of advancing humanity forward. In Angel's very own eyes, that dream was visible to Dave once more, as he smiled warmly. He already knew enough, and even if the logs provided by 4C seemed to prove otherwise, even if the stained, crimson red spearhead, even if the SOLARsec escort seemed to act as an alarm for Dave to stray away, he knew that the piece of Angelina that had been buried deep within Angel's mind was still there. Angelina wasn't dead, and this only solidified his hope, his wish. \
**"Lower your weapons."** Angel instructed the escort, and in an instant, all heads turned into her direction in surprise. *"Angel..?"* The Elite guard to her side asked, completely dumbfounded by her decision to let the supposed threat off the hook. *"Are you sure? We don't kn-"* \
**"Lower. Your weapons."** Angel interrupted him, her eyes fiery as she turned her head towards the Elite guard. **"No questions asked. I will handle this matter privately."** She continued, her eyes now returning to those of Dave. The glimmer in her eyes had faded, but Dave's feint smile remained. Lowering their weapons, the first group of guards continued through the hallway, continuing towards their destination while Angel continued to stare back into Dave's eyes. Still, she recognised the face, and struggled to find an answer as to why that was the case. **"Await me at the Southern Bridge. There's something about this scientist I need to figure out by myself."**
