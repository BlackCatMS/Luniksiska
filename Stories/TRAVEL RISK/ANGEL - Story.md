# ANGEL - Story
**ANGEL** is a story that is in *active and early development*. It is set to integrate the following:
- [[Internal Channels]]: **Internal Channels** is a collection of communication and interaction logs monitored by Unit 4C. Though looks may be deceiving for a unit of this size, its capabilities far exceed one's expectations. 
- [[KILLJOY - Story]]: **KILLJOY** as a story connects [[TRAVEL RISK]] with SOLARdawn and subsequently **Project Angel**, tying together the remains of Kristánisin's **Agency** through the means of **Nils** and **Nova**. 
While Project Angel is undergoing development, **Dave Mullan**, a director and researcher under **SOLARdawn** is in frequent contact with his long-time friend and colleague, **Angelina Velana**, who is also a prestigious researcher within SOLARdawn. After her own promotion, she gained insider intel and was allowed a look into the past projects that have been worked on in secret in not just SOLARdawn, but also in its previous company: **PALMER-EDEN**. Being a researcher that is eager to learn more, eager to strive for more, she decides to dust off the Ultima project and attempts to unlock humanity's full potential with **Vitaly Leremkov**'s ongoing development. However, it would require a human test subject willing enough to be the recipient of not just the Ultima organ in question, but also willing enough to undergo a 22-hour long surgery. Even with all risks involved, the only person that remained willing enough to become the recipient or vessel of the project is Angelina herself. 

The procedure comes with risks of their own, and the extended stress on the vessel's nervous system can lead to severe amnesia, or even to a complete loss of memory. Even if the project would succeed, the vessel would still need to relearn everything from step one onwards. And yet, in **August 2074**, the last green light illuminates and the project receives a go.

**Dave Mullan**, on the other hand, is transferred to the campus of **Alexandrie Pharmaceuticals** to continue his research there with his team. Having already lost contact with Angelina, he was now completely isolated altogether from coming in contact with her at all, leaving him only able to wonder and hope that the operation and project wasn't for nothing in the end.

**Off the deep end**: How does the ambitious Angelina in **2074** become the executioner in **2076**? Drafted is that **Dr. Francis Ezarea**, who was the one to carry out the heart surgery to her, replacing her heart with the **Flame Heart** organ, allowing her to utilise the power provided through the means of the old **Ultima project**. Recognising her newfound capabilities, Ezarea decided to amend the project that Angelina had laid out for herself for during her rehabilitation process, and instead of having herself relearn to become a prestigious researcher once more, he instead opts to use her Flame Heart for power and strength alone, transferring her to **SOLARsec** in **Myrdiva** where she soon grows into her role of executioner. 

Francis's reasoning for averting from the original project's planning is the **Failure of Project Gradient** in **2073** and the potential that he saw in Angel with her **Flame Heart**. Angel's amnesia gave Francis a clean canvas to convince the recovering Angel that her powers were used for good hands, even if it meant that she would become nothing more but a killing machine, and an executioner. 

In **August 2076**, the project for **Alexandrie** that **Dave Mullan** had been a part of has reached its conclusion, and returning to the SOLARdawn campus, he immediately connects with a Terminal once more to see the progress made in Angelina's recovery. By now, it had been almost two years since he had last seen her, which gave him hope that her recovery was proceeding well, or had even been completed by now. But to his shock and horror, 4C explains to Dave in which direction the project instead had gone to. Instead of returning to her research once more, Angel was reduced to nothing more but a cold-blooded killer, working for **SOLARsec** in **Myrdiva**. Without a second thought, even with all risks involved, Dave sets off to Myrdiva, in hopes to steer Angel in the right direction once more, in hopes that she would at least remember him, ending up on a back-and-forth journey in a desperate attempt to find a lead that'd bring him to Angel.

**"Remember"**: Following **KILLJOY** and during **HEAVY RAINFALL WARNING**, Dave makes his way to Amadnésam, closely following 4C's directions and data points to lead him directly to Angel. Frozen in place and frozen in time in the halls of the SOLARdawn campus once more, Dave finds Angel escorted by various SOLARsec guards, but to both of their surprise, their eyes meet, and Angel stands still in place. To her surprise, she recognised Dave's face, but struggled to connect the dots, to figure out *why* it was that he was so familiar to her. Trying to approach her, Dave finds himself held at gunpoint by the escorting guards, until Angel steps out of the escort, gesturing the guards to lower their weapons. *// Obviously, more details than this are necessary, but that's why it's the finale. It's subject to change, but food for thought.*
