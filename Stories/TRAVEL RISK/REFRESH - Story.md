### Beyond the Rifle
It had barely been a week since I topped my own records and eliminated Dominico's target, paving the way for the next chapters in our respective lives. Dominico would pick up old contacts after confirming that I had no side-effects or mishaps since receiving my fox traits, and even thought about returning to Poland. But for myself, I received a strange letter dressed in orange from a company that called itself **"Vátnelári"**. Intrigued, I opened the letter, eager to see what this mysteriously dressed letter had to offer me. \
Reading through it, the first words already ticked me off. *"To Katherina Mikkë."* I sighed, already annoyed enough that they were using the name I had hated since my youth. But eager to figure out what was going on, I continued to peek through the letter, picking out words that interested me, or stood out. *Reportedly hit a 5.3km shot..*, *been keeping our eyes on you..*, *gained interest..*, *invitation to Egórecë..* The name began to make sense to me, but the invitation did not. Vátnelári were middlemen and hitmen, why did they take interest in me? I continued to read through the latter paragraphs more carefully, the first paragraph was nothing but praise regardless, and I needed to figure out why they were so keen on approaching me and offering a contract. They offered me a stay in Egórecë, and a professional training to help me adjust to the different combat scenarios that might appear during my future missions. And even with all these provided services, they promised the pay would be *excellent*.

Standing in front of the mirror in the bathroom once more, I took a moment to go over everything that had just happened. Whatever else it was that Nathan would want to tell me, he could collapse dead at the bar at any moment now, if Vátnelári hadn't lied to me. I checked my purse, my clothing, and made sure that nothing was out of the ordinary. But taking one more look into the mirror and seeing my own reflection, I felt my heart skip a beat once more, still struggling to adapt to my new silhouette. *"At least I can still hear.."* I thought to myself. Splashing some water on my face to help me get back to my senses, I heard two knocks on the bathroom door, immediately followed by the familiar voice of the bartender that I had gotten in touch with before striking up the conversation with Nathan. **"Kath..-"** He began, immediately realising and adjusting his mishap. **"Nova.. Nathan collapsed at the bar, your mission is complete."** I turned off the tap and quickly dried my face, before opening the bathroom door and caught him as he was making his way back to the bar. Turning around after I tapped his shoulder, I gave him a handshake, thanking him once more for
