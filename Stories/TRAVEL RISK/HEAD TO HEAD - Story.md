# HEAD TO HEAD - Story
The year is **2075**. Long after the **United States** collapsed, and PALMER-EDEN had taken over. Ever since, the States had rearranged, had been divided and reunited countless times, before reaching the point where they are in the current year. PALMER-EDEN had scaled down to just the nation of Illinois, most of the north and northeast was now part of Canada, and the states that revolted against the reign of PALMER-EDEN were met with obliteration, until the formation of the Southern States. While still recovering from the loss of life and property, the state of **Florida** seemed to have recovered like nothing happened, with **Cape Canaveral** now serving home to connections on Earth, and connections to Lúniks. And for Dáritke, this opens a door for grey market trades.

## HEAD TO HEAD - Story
### Drafted
**Mika**, on his most recent mission for **Dáritke**, is sent to **Florida, SS** to close a trade for Neurokicks that they had acquired a few weeks prior. Tagging along with the **ELE**, he enters a flight to **Cape Canaveral** and is thereafter planned to go to **Miami** to meet the representative in an older, abandoned factory dating back many decades before. Once there, he is instead met with closed doors, and with the age of the factory, has to force himself inside by other means that are not digital, but doing so successfully while waiting for a signal from the representative, he begins a little exploration mission of his own to learn more about the factory, its place in the outskirts of **Miami**, and learns more about the destruction that **PALMER-EDEN** had caused on not just **Florida**, but every State on the Atlantic Coast.

At the same time, **Gradient** is on a mission here with **Hammerhead**, although alone in the factory. The two pick up one another's sounds, and begin to track each other down, before suddenly finding themselves looking down the barrel of each other's pistols.

### In with the old
*"Travellers to: Florida, Southern States. Departure in ten minutes."*

The automated announcements were fairly soothing to listen to, and despite such a crowded corridor, still sounded crisp and clear to every person in the boarding hall. **"Ten minutes.. Should board.."** Mika mumbled to himself, holding the pass dearly in his hand. **Cape Canaveral**, he would be departing for today, a place on Earth that had seen many space flights a century ago, and even more history ever since. But Mika wouldn't travel here for a chitchat, or to learn more about the history of how humanity once came to settle Lúniks, he was going to close the Neurokick trade that he had stolen from Ódóni a month ago. 

Stepping through the gate after having his pass scanned, he cautiously walked through the otherwise empty tube that led him to the interstellar ship that would bring him to Earth in just under 10 minutes. He didn't really know anything about the ins and the outs of the ship, all that mattered to him is that it would bring him safely to **Cape Canaveral**, and eventually, **Miami**, where his final stop was. Taking a window seat, one that *Kasper* had reserved for him, he looked back at the airfield to the left. He'd flown a few times before to Zhuehai, because it would simply take too long to reach it by train and ferry, so it wasn't a strange sight for him to see the various planes and spaceships arrive and depart from his window view. But before long, the tube let go of the spaceship and left behind the sealed door, and the almost-empty spaceship to Earth was about to depart.

The strange feeling of a cosmic force pressing on your body was something that would always remain. Even 70 years after the departure of **One**, kickstarting the settlement of Lúniks, there would always be a feeling of butterflies in your stomach when you travel through the *Panjit Loop*. But distracted by the mission form in his hands, Mika didn't notice this all too much. The only thing that caused him to look up from the form, were the streaks of light passing by his window as the ship went through the loop. And as soon as they had appeared, they quickly reached a standstill in space again, coming face to face with the blue planet of Earth. *"Dear passengers-"* The intercom crackled right away, *"We have arrived at Earth. Standby for landing in Florida."*

**"That's.. fast.."** Mika mumbled to himself, his eyes now fixated on the unfamiliar planet right outside his window. To him, it was the same experience as the original crew of the exploration ships had in 2005. The feeling of familiarity with the planet, while also knowing that this was a place they'd never been to before. \
The landing happened smoothly, and went according to the tight schedule and protocols that Mika was more familiar with, akin to regular flights that he'd taken before. Taxiing off the runway, it wasn't long before the tube connected with the spaceship, and unsealed the door, allowing Mika and the other passengers to exit.

It didn't take long before he found himself back in a seat once more. The train station was right underneath the air- and spaceport, and setting himself an alarm, he dozed off momentarily, as the train quietly made its departure from underneath **Cape Canaveral**, it was set to terminate at **Miami**, where Mika was set to go.
### What once was 
The train station was surprisingly crowded. Mika had heard numerous stories about how **Florida** was totally devastated and left in ruins after the bombings in **2035**, but 40 years later, it seemed to him like none of that was visible anymore. The majority of the State, especially the north, was reduced to merely a desert landscape, and only served home to a few corridors for public transport and a few highways, but didn't seem to serve home to any of its citizens. Shaking his head, he steps out through the gates, and made his way to the old factory he was set to go, a few minutes by foot away.

Stretching his arms, Mika reaches the factory a little over 10 minutes later, and promptly walked to the backdoor where he was tasked to break into. Already lifting his left wrist, he realises that there's no automated safety system to be found, rendering his wrist rabbit virtually useless. **"That's great."** He scoffs sarcastically, tapping his right shoulder gently as blue liquid begins to flow through his arm. **"Oldschool buildings, oldschool break-in."** He didn't have a classic pistol on hand that could break the lock in one shot, of course, having gone through interstellar travel. But in his backpack, he did have a lockpick set that he carried in case his wrist rabbit would fail him in "the worst case". Even with his wrist rabbit functional, he couldn't use it to break into the factory, so taking a pin from the set, he carefully inserts it into the lock, hearing a series of *clicks* as he forced it into the lock, twisting it along the way. Finicking with the lock, it suddenly unlocks, pushing the door forward and catches Mika off guard as he almost trips forward into the dusty, abandoned factory. 

Carefully and quietly closing the door behind him, he takes a moment to adjust to the darkness of the factory. Despite the roof having broken open in a few spots, it wasn't nearly enough to light up all the corners of the enormous factory. Looking at the various heavy machinery, automated processes that had been abandoned, he checks his watch. **"Two hours early. Could take a peek around."** He mumbles to himself, deciding to go right to the old main floor office, eager to discover what the factory was once used for before it was abandoned. 

To his surprise, the door to the office wasn't locked, and carefully twisting the knob, he entered inside. The windows were originally meant for those in the office to keep an eye at the main floor at all times, and he could see various red buttons to immediately halt the machines in case of an emergency, but after being closed off for so long, the glass had turned opaque from the dust, and the colours of the furniture had lost their colours too, being coated in a generous layer of dust. On various signs and documents, he could frequently see the same names being passed along. **"United States"**, and the flag of the Southern States, with many more stars. It didn't make too much sense to Mika, but now having discovered this, he wasn't going to stop here, he wanted to learn much more.

Tapping his left shoulder, a shiver went through his body, and he activated his cloak. Despite having doubts that this factory would still utilise a camera feed, he didn't want to take any risks at all. After all, he didn't want to disturb the trade he was set to complete either. Stepping towards the back of the office, he began to peek through a series of drawers, most of which boiling down to financial reports, but a few stood out to him. **"Government papers.."** He whispered to himself. He found a few folders regarding development for **PALMER-EDEN**, and another drawer dedicated exclusively to a project named **"Ultima"**. Things were beginning to ramp up, and making sure not to overstuff his backpack, he took a few documents to read through, and to bring home. Classified or not, these were left behind to collect dust, it couldn't hurt for a stranger to take a peek at them, right? He skipped through more drawers, finding documents dating back to **2035**, and out of curiosity, he opened a page titled "Distress signal". It appeared to be an automatically generated log of some sorts, but to his surprise, was mostly written in a legible language.

*"LOG_ENTRY 467534. DATE: 230835* \
*TYPE: DISTRESS. BLACKBOX.* \
*Office 1 (Main floor Main) has initiated an emergency evacuation.* \
*Given reason: Air raid sirens have been activated. Incoming air attack. Rockets of Illinoisan origin. Presumed to be launched by Palmer-Eden.* \
*Lockdown initiated. Machines halted. Evacuation protocol initiated.* \
*LOG_EXIT. If you are reading this, may the States be free once more."*

**"May the States be free once more.."** Mika mumbled to himself, repeating the last line of the log over and over again. **"Once more.. Have they not always been?.."** To Mika, the "United States" were always just another term to refer to the Southern States, in which he found himself now. He'd heard stories and legacies about Palmer-Eden, but hadn't they been Illinoisan since the start? The puzzle was beginning to appear before him, but he struggled to solve it. Canada's strange borders, the landlocked Central America, California, the Southern States, had they been united before? 

Shaking his head, he stuffs the last folder in his backpack as well and instead decides to walk around the factory. If they'd been under attack, what were they originally up to here? And to his surprise, it seemed to be in the best shape as it possibly could, there hadn't been rocket impacts here, was it all a fluke, or another department's distress signal? Mika carefully closed the door behind him and began to walk upwards in the factory, reaching the upper levels and giving himself a view of the machinery from above. He felt like he was missing something obvious, it seemed like a standard steel factory, one that would supply Florida with all its needs considering its size. But the folder named **"Ultima"** continued to irk him. Something was being hidden from plain sight, or had been moved, but what could it possibly be?
### Head to Head
Walking further up the steel staircases to the top floor, he suddenly heard another step echo through the enormous halls of the factory. Steps that he didn't take. **"Someone else is present."** He thought to himself. Immediately checking his watch, he realised it was still 85 minutes away before the client would arrive for the Neurokick trade, and with Dáritke's tight and precise schedules, this couldn't be the client. Frantically tapping his left shoulder once more, he engages his cloak a step further, silencing his own steps while tracking those of the intruder. Taking the pulse pistol out of his backpack, he begins to scan through the factory, the steps getting closer and closer, then disappearing into the distance again. Whoever it was, they weren't actively hunting for him, but Mika most certainly was after them.

With the volume of his steps silenced, Mika began to walk through the different floors of the balconies above the factory in search of the intruder. He could hear his own, quiet steps, but was nearing those of the figure he was trying to chase after. But every time he believed to be on the right floor, the steps vanished off into the distance, and from top to bottom, Mika scouted the floors, until he reached the main floor again without a result. Something particular came up in his mind, as he carefully took a handful of steps forward, hearing the steps follow closely behind him. The steps couldn't be his own, but neither would it make sense for those to be the intruder's. Experimenting just a bit more, looking behind him countless times, he finds nothing yet again. 

Taking two steps forward, he hears a delay in the echoes of the steps. Immediately reaching for his Pulse pistol on his hip, he takes it out of its holster and turns around in one swift motion, aiming down at the face of a seemingly young woman, who was aiming a more classic pistol at his own head. **"You're not the client."** Mika scoffed. *"You're not from HEART."* The voice replied.

***"Who are you?"***

Keeping their pistols raised at one another's head for a moment, Mika was the first to lower his own. Tossing it on the floor at his feet, he raises his hands in the air, showing no harm. Confused, the young woman lowers her pistol as well, as Mika begins to explain. **"Pistol wasn't warmed anyway. It wouldn't have fired, and yours is lethal as well."** He says, a notable tone of defeat in his voice as he kicks his pistol to the side as the figure before him holsters her own. **"Leaves me wondering nonetheless. HEART?"** \
*"Hammerhead Extraction And Rescue Team. The name's Gradient."* Gradient quickly replied, her stance still indicating a sense of unsafeness and alertness. \
**"Hammerhead, huh.."** Mika begins, slowly bouncing on his feet to break the awkwardness. **"What brings you to an abandoned factory in Miami of all places?"** \
Gradient crossed her cybernetic arms as Mika walked towards his pistol to retrieve and holster it once more, making sure to show her that he enabled safety. *"I was told I could find old documents from Palmer-Eden's research here.* She began, *"I didn't expect company. who are you?"* \
**"Mika Andzákin. Dáritke netrunner."** Mika was quick to reply, holding his hand out and offering a kind handshake. **"Have a trade here in about an hour, client from Florida, delivery from Máneá."**
Deflated, and clearly disappointed with Mika's answer, she instead turns to face away and made her way to the main floor office.

**"Palmer-Eden, you said?"** Mika suddenly interrupted her as she twisted the knob of the door. **"I'm intrigued. Tell me more, I have time to kill."**
