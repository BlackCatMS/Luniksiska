# KILLJOY - Story
(*// This story has moved to [[ANGEL - Story#TEN - FATE]].*)
## Rough outline // Sketch
After meeting in the fateful bar in **Egórecë** soon after Nova had completed her inaugural mission for **Vátnelári**, Nils managed to convince her to immediately break ties with her agency, and after explaining the situation that he found himself in after the fall of Kristánisin's Agency (*// Essentially homeless without an Agency or person to fall back to*), Nova agrees and the two decide to pick up arms together and begin their netrunning journey. 

It seemed easier said than done, however, and after a month, the two find themselves stable financially and mentally, but under heavy threat from their surroundings. Even after Máneá had been declared "safe" after the departure of **Dáritke**, it didn't mean that it was completely devoid of threats. Before long, their paths are cut short and Nils ends up being ambushed and captured by a mysterious group of people dressed in black. (*// These sections will not be build into the story initially, but may become additions later on to further dress up the atmosphere and scene*), leaving Nova on her own once more.

Nils soon finds himself in a relatively bright and open room, surrounded by glass windows in what seems to be a disconnected section of a much larger office. In reality, Nils is captured and kept by a **SOLARdawn** division, and in due time, he is informed by "**Angel**" that he and Nova, amongst many others, have dwelled in too much with secret information regarding projects within SOLARdawn. "Angel" is straight to the point. She won't waste too much time, as Nils is not alone in line to be personally sent to Heaven by this "Angel". 

Somehow, someway, Nova is informed by (*// either a third party or Nils's pinger*) about Nils's location, and making her way towards this mysterious cubicle in the middle of a grass field, she sprints towards the glass box with a marksman rifle loaded and trained (*// HR-62-L Variation?*) and fires without a second thought. Unfortunately for both Nils and Nova, "Angel" seemed to have noticed Nova's presence long in advance, and raising her fist (*// Motion from waist upwards, hard to explain through words*) the walls to her left immediately close, followed by the rest of the glass covering itself up, leaving Nils in complete and total darkness. "**"A shame, our killjoy is here."**" is a line that "Angel" will say before accelerating Nils's imminent execution.

**!! Chronologically, this takes place a few months after [[FATED ENCOUNTER - Story]]. Unlike that story, however, none of the three aforementioned characters will make an appearance in this story *specifically*.**
