# KILLJOY - Story
## Rough outline // Sketch
After meeting in the fateful bar in **Egórecë** soon after Nova had completed her inaugural mission for **Vátnelári**, Nils managed to convince her to immediately break ties with her agency, and after explaining the situation that he found himself in after the fall of Kristánisin's Agency (*// Essentially homeless without an Agency or person to fall back to*), Nova agrees and the two decide to pick up arms together and begin their netrunning journey. 

It seemed easier said than done, however, and after a month, the two find themselves stable financially and mentally, but under heavy threat from their surroundings. Even after Máneá had been declared "safe" after the departure of **Dáritke**, it didn't mean that it was completely devoid of threats. Before long, their paths are cut short and Nils ends up being ambushed and captured by a mysterious group of people dressed in black. (*// These sections will not be build into the story initially, but may become additions later on to further dress up the atmosphere and scene*), leaving Nova on her own once more.

Nils soon finds himself in a relatively bright and open room, surrounded by glass windows in what seems to be a disconnected section of a much larger office. In reality, Nils is captured and kept by a **SOLARdawn** division, and in due time, he is informed by "**Angel**" that he and Nova, amongst many others, have dwelled in too much with secret information regarding projects within SOLARdawn. "Angel" is straight to the point. She won't waste too much time, as Nils is not alone in line to be personally sent to Heaven by this "Angel". 

Somehow, someway, Nova is informed by (*// either a third party or Nils's pinger*) about Nils's location, and making her way towards this mysterious cubicle in the middle of a grass field, she sprints towards the glass box with a marksman rifle loaded and trained (*// HR-62-L Variation?*) and fires without a second thought. Unfortunately for both Nils and Nova, "Angel" seemed to have noticed Nova's presence long in advance, and raising her fist (*// Motion from waist upwards, hard to explain through words*) the walls to her left immediately close, followed by the rest of the glass covering itself up, leaving Nils in complete and total darkness. "**"A shame, our killjoy is here."**" is a line that "Angel" will say before accelerating Nils's imminent execution.

**!! Chrononically, this takes place around the same time as [[FATED ENCOUNTER - Story]]. Unlike that story, however, none of the three aforementioned characters will make an appearance in this story *specifically*.**

## Killjoy
### Heaven, or so thought
The atmosphere in the room that Nils found himself in felt tense, and oddly warm yet cold at the same time. The air felt stuffy, yet full at once. Feeling like he was struggling to breathe, so did he feel like there was an overflow of pure oxygen in the very room he was in. And yet, he felt blind. With eyes wide open, all he could see was a black mass in front of his eyes, with shimmers of light piercing the cloth placed over his head. The reason the air felt stuffy now became clear to him. He was constantly cycling through his own breaths. Something was wrapped tightly around his neck, leaving him breathing more roughly than normal. But it didn't take long before a figure presented himself behind him, and tapping his shoulders twice with their hands, they remained quiet as the pressure around Nils's neck was relieved, the cord loosening ever so slightly to allow him to breathe a bit more comfortably. But within a matter of seconds, he felt the figure's hands move and press upwards, tracing his neck, ears, and scalp, before firmly gripping the cloth at the very top and pulling it off in a swift motion. In total surprise, Nils closes his eyes immediately to prevent being blinded by the bright light that had been hiding behind the cloth.

It didn't take long for Nils to adjust to the brightness of the room he found himself in, but to his surprise, he did start to feel pressure around his wrists, and blinking a few times to adjust to the lights, he was quick to find out where he now found himself in. Before him was a generously-dressed woman, sitting behind a luxurious desk akin to what the President of Thórirsant had in his office. Behind her rough, wavy white hair was a bookshelf that was decorated by a coat of arms right behind her back, and while the emblem itself was hidden behind the woman before him, he could pick out the wings of an angel at the bottom of the coat, almost making it look like they belonged to the mysterious woman at the opposite end of the desk. Nils himself found himself stuck in more of a budget chair, with his wrists strapped firmly to the backrest of the chair, not allowing him to move at all, and looking around him, the remaining walls of the door were simply glass windows, stretching out into a grass field that led almost infinitely into the distance. But to Nils's surprise, he couldn't spot anything much further into the distance. No trees, no fields of flowers, not even an elevation change or a shack. He was being surrounded by the very same men dressed in black that had brought him here, keeping watch over him to prevent any sudden actions taken by him. Nils exhaled quietly, and turned back around to face the woman before him, who continuously kept the same expression: A neutral stare deeply into Nils's soul. Her appearance left him with more mysteries than answers. Her eyes seemed to be almost inhumanly bright, bright turquoise irises decorated by generous eyelashes and eyebrows, and that wasn't even mentioning the enormous fox ears at the very top of her head, the tip of the spear to her long, white hair. 

Nils's heart sank to his chest in fear the very second he saw her open her mouth, hoping to hear answers about where he had been transported to, but bracing himself to hear the exact opposite as well. *"Nils Lorieux."* She began. Her voice was fairly monotone, and didn't have any emotion sprinkled between her words. She sounded extremely professional, which crossed off many checkboxes in Nils's head immediately. Whatever it was, he had messed up somewhere in one of his previous missions, and now seemed to be on the receiving end of whatever reprimand that would follow. *"Are you aware of the reason I have had you brought here?"* \
Nils immediately shook his head, and looking around him, he felt multiple pairs of eyes stare directly into his soul, leaving burn marks on his mind with their faces hidden behind a mask and tinted glasses. **"I do not know, madam."** Nils replied, a hint of defeat in his voice. He was tied up to his chair, overseen by at least 5 men, and the woman before him was giving him the shivers as well. No matter how hard he would try to come up with an escape plan, it would be struck down immediately. As much as he hated to admit it, he was well and truly pushed into a corner in this moment. **"If I may ask, what is the reason?"** \
To Nils's surprise, a slight smile appeared on the woman's face behind the desk, leaving him only more afraid of what she would have to say. But instead, the smile faded almost immediately, and shaking her head slowly, she began to explain the reason for Nils's surprise stay in this cubicle. *"Nils Lorieux, you have simply trespassed where you shouldn't have. You learned something that was to be kept secret, and instead of turning back to correct your errors, you instead shared that knowledge with others, simply for your own benefit. You were aware of all risks involved, and yet, you marched forward."* She said, the monotone voice disappearing near the end as a smile began to appear on her face at the very end. She seemed to be enjoying this, and that thought alone left Nils more fearful of what was to come. *"I hope this does not come as a surprise to you."* She continued, her brows furrowing slightly as her eyes now stared directly at Nils's own as well, completing the circle of eyes staring deeply into Nils's soul. *"Your debts do not interest me, Nils Lorieux. The price is your life."* \

Nils felt his heart simultaneously jump into his throat, and sink to his feet. Whatever he had been fearing, whatever it had been that he was expecting her to say, a death penalty wasn't on his mind in the slightest. And yet, the look in her eyes told him enough. Whoever she was, it wasn't a joke. Nils's life was on the line. His heart skipped a beat as he saw the woman stand up from her chair, now towering well above him even from across the desk. It allowed Nils to get a more proper look at the woman's outfit, but it left him with many more questions that he wasn't sure he would have the opportunity to to have them answered. She was wearing what seemed to be a traditionally Thórirsantic robe, decorated by a fur collar. But to Nils's horror, it seemed to be stained by blood. **"M-may I ask.."** Nils spurted out, his eyes open wide, his voice shaky from fear. Images were through his mind, presenting him his past. His life with his parents, and him waving them goodbye before their return to France, the very last time he had seen them all those years ago. He saw his Agency's members before his very eyes, as if he were hallucinating. Raléi stood before him, next to Omáti, and Maria. And yet, one by one, they faded away. Raléi had been killed, Omáti had died, and for all he knew, Maria would've been killed too on her way to Jóthul. From the four prestigious members of the Agency, he was the last one to stand. And yet, here he was, seated and strapped to a chair, about to be the last member to fall. **"Madam, I'd like to hear my executioner's name."** \
A quiet chuckle came from the woman before him, followed by a wide smile. \
*"My name is irrelevant to you, Nils."* She smiled, stepping away from the desk to make her way towards Nils himself. But to his horror, he saw her take a generously decorated spear from the wall, holding it firmly in her left hand before she suddenly stood before Nils. The coat of arms remained clearly visible right behind her, and the wings remained prominent, sprouting from her waist as she towered above him. *"But for your remaining minutes, you may refer to me as an Angel. Tell me, do you prefer heaven or hell? I will personally bring you there."* 

Nils felt his throat clog up, and staring up at Angel , his eyes drifted towards the spear. The tip was sharp, and looked like it would easily pierce right through his chest. And to his horror, it seemed like it had done so many, many times before. The tip had been stained in a deep, crimson red, trailing and seeping down the shaft. It seemed to be decorated by various means of fur, of traditional Thórirsantic charms, and other ritualistic attributes. Nils kept quiet, his mind simply didn't give him the opportunity to reply. He was shellshocked at the sight before him, the realisation of the situation that was unfolding before his very eyes. His days were numbered, no, his minutes were. The light in the cubicle had dimmed over time, the sun seemed to be setting, and the clouds had made their appearance, increasingly tensing up the atmosphere of the room which felt like it was growing smaller with each breath. All stares that were fixated on him burnt into his skin, through his clothing, into his soul. \
**"Heaven."** Nils managed to whisper out, fighting through his nerves, fighting for his life. If this was really the end for him, he wouldn't let his last opportunity to receive a good end go to waste. Angel gave him the shivers, but the voice inside his head told him that she was only doing this because she was told to. But that thought didn't last too long. *"Shame."* She began, the distance between the two growing as she lifted her spear up. Its shaft began to emit a mysterious glow, and with the room now darkening almost completely, the light outside had become night, and it had begun storming. The only light that would illuminate the room, was the tip of the spear, which ignited to create a furiously waving flame. *"Your actions will lead you to hell."* She continued, and in a slow motion, the spear now moved forward, held perfectly straight in place horizontally, a mere metre away from Nils's face, as the flame's heat started to cause sweat to trickle down from his forehead. His eyes were fixated on the flame, the burning tip of the spear. Within a matter of seconds, he knew that it would pierce straight through his chest, igniting him internally and externally, leaving him no time to breathe, no time to live. *"Apologies are futile, Nils."* Angel interrupted, placing a barricade in his thought process before Nils even knew where it was heading. This woman was getting increasingly mysterious, and he struggled to figure out just why. 

A loud crash suddenly filled the room, and glancing to his right, Nils saw the familiar face of Nova appear behind the door. The outside view had been a simulation, and it seemed to be merely a set of displays that were interrupted by Nova opening the door behind them. She was wielding a rifle, and Nils's eyes opened wide. It was trained on Angel, who didn't seem to be dazed by the interruption at all. In a matter of seconds, the flame began to dwindle, and a loud gunshot echoed through the room, the muzzle flash of the rifle illuminating the corner in the room. Somehow, Nova had found her way towards the room Nils found himself transported to, and had come in at the exact right time. But his hopes remained short. To his surprise, Angel seemed to have expected this outcome, and clenching her left hand into a fist, she lifted it up into the air, followed by a wall closing to her left, blocking the bullet as if it was nothing. The flame on the spear disappeared, leaving darkness filling the room completely. But even so, Angel's eyes continued to stare deeply into Nils's soul, illuminated ever so slightly in the darkness. Her brows furrowed, and the retrieved the spear, now holding it firmly against the floor while keeping her left fist clenched and held upwards to keep the summoned wall raised. *"A shame, our killjoy is here."*
### Execution interruption
*// Nils and Nova now find themselves in a dire situation. The people dressed in black now have their pistols trained on the two young netrunners, and between the two stands Angel, who seemed to be much more powerful than Nils could ever have imagined. The spear igniting from her touch alone already said a lot, but having control over the room they were in seemed to be the next outrageous development in the ever worsening situation. Despite her skill, Nova was simply outnumbered, and couldn't kill any of the guards in the room. Even if she was well-equipped, Nils was sure that Angel would just become a guard to them, shielding any bullets that were to fire.*

*// The tip of the spear ignites once more, and so do Angel's eyes. The hour of Nils's execution is still approaching, and it doesn't take long before the spear is held right before his chest once more, the flames of the spear almost igniting his clothing, burning his skin without even coming in contact. Below are snippets that might be translated into the full chapter.*

**!! This is due a rewrite, as it is only conceptual and descriptive.** \
The fire continued to seep ever closer to his skin, evaporating each drop of sweat that was rolling down his face. His own eyes became fiery, too, matching the gaze that Angel was holding towards Nils's own face past the flames of her spear. **"Tell me, Angel, before I die."** Nils smiled. **"Who-.. *what* are you?"** \
Angel's brows remained furrowed, her gaze unchanged. *"A complete dictionary of last words you could've said, and yet, you chose this."* She scoffed, her spear remaining unchanged, and inching ever closer to Nils's chest. *"I am SOLARdawn's Angel, executioner, and experiment. More you do not need to know."* She said, the monotone yet angry tone in her voice more prominent than ever. The spear retracted slightly, and Nils's heart skipped a beat. Its next move would be a fast pierce forward, and would be his immediate end.
