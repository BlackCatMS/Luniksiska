# TRAVEL RISK
**TRAVEL RISK**: Certain areas on Earth and Luniks have been deemed *"Unsafe to travel to"*, after numerous incidents related to gang wars and plundering, and general unrest within the area. These areas usually are older, abandoned and out-developed cities that aren't given the same care and supplies that most modern cities receive, with good examples being **Deth-Kelétam (Máneá)**, and **Duisburg (Germany)**. Areas like these include an elevated risk of biological damage upon entrance, and as a result of this, these areas are more prone to diseases like *Leremkov* and *Lucky Water Defect*, leading to results that were even out of the original creator's control. 

# PROJECT REORGANISATION
Per 2024 I want to develop this project in particular into something that can grow into a fully fledged-out story. One that has a clear start, and a clear end, and a series of characters that frequently return and go through the same chapters together. **LUCKY WATER**, **NEUROKICK**, **LEREMKOV**, and every drug that might be created along the way, will be included and will frequently make a return in one way or another. 
## FOCUS ONE: LUCKY WATER
The above described drug, *Lucky Water*, has moved to [[LUCKY WATER]] in order to free up this document as an informative document. 
## FOCUS TWO: NEUROKICK
Available at [[NEUROKICK]]. **NEUROKICK** is an electronic injection-type drug that greatly exaggerates the visual feedback the brain can produce. This additionally can force the user to enter a REM sleep, where the rest of the drug continues its effect during the forced dream state. 
## FOCUS THREE: LEREMKOV
Available at [[LEREMKOV]]. While Leremkov is described as a disease similar to Influenza and Covid, it has been altered and modified even further behind closed, underground doors. Despite not being as prominent as drugs like **Lucky Water**, its effects are more of a threat to the human race than Leremkov itself is. 

## STORIES
### TRAVEL RISK 
Available at [[TRAVEL RISK - Story]]. \
Following a history of shady businesses and shady transactions, **Nils Lorieux** achieves his dream of fullfilling the wish of his parents: Moving back to France. But now living on his own in the ever worsening living standards of Máneá, he stumbles upon **Antoine Russeau**, who was given the exact same mission as Nils. Teaming up, Antoine introduces him to **Dáritke** after a number of weeks, where Nils is assigned to a delivery mission to Egórecë. During this mission, he was instead captured by members of **The Agency**, where he was promptly invited to cross over from Dáritke. Without a doubt, he burns his bridges with Dáritke, but from one Agency into another, the troubles don't disappear.

With an eye for precision and an eye for perfection, any target that landed in her sights was a dead one, but desperate to climb the ladder and go beyond her capabilities, she seeks out a blend between Leremkov and her Neurotech, one that was provided by **Dominico**, a close contact of *Leremkov*. Completing her transformation and adapting at ease, she lands her first shot beyond 5km with ease, meaning her ceiling just increased thousandfold.

**Dominico**'s target is dead, at the hands of **Nova**. But with a record-breaking shot like hers, Zakh'háfon agency **Vátnelári** takes interest in her, and invites her to join their specialised team.
