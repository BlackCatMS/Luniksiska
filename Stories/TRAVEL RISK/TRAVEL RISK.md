# TRAVEL RISK
**TRAVEL RISK**: Certain areas on Earth and Luniks have been deemed *"Unsafe to travel to"*, after numerous incidents related to gang wars and plundering, and general unrest within the area. These areas usually are older, abandoned and out-developed cities that aren't given the same care and supplies that most modern cities receive, with good examples being **Deth-Kelétam (Máneá)**, and **Duisburg (Germany)**. Areas like these include an elevated risk of biological damage upon entrance, and as a result of this, these areas are more prone to diseases like *Leremkov* and *Lucky Water Defect*, leading to results that were even out of the original creator's control. 

# PROJECT REORGANISATION
In 2024 I want to develop this project in particular into something that can grow into a fully fledged-out story. One that has a clear start, and a clear end, and a series of characters that frequently return and go through the same chapters together. **LUCKY WATER**, **NEUROKICK**, **LEREMKOV**, and every drug that might be created along the way, will be included and will frequently make a return in one way or another. 
## FOCUS ONE: LUCKY WATER
The above described drug, *Lucky Water*, has moved to [[LUCKY WATER]] in order to free up this document as an informative document. 
## FOCUS TWO: NEUROKICK
Available at [[NEUROKICK]]. **NEUROKICK** is an electronic injection-type drug that greatly exaggerates the visual feedback the brain can produce. This additionally can force the user to enter a REM sleep, where the rest of the drug continues its effect during the forced dream state. 
## FOCUS THREE: LEREMKOV
Available at [[LEREMKOV]]. While Leremkov is described as a disease similar to Influenza and Covid, it has been altered and modified even further behind closed, underground doors. Despite not being as prominent as drugs like **Lucky Water**, its effects are more of a threat to the human race than Leremkov itself is. 

## STORIES
### MAIN STORYLINE
The main storyline follows **Nils** and his integration into **The Agency** under **Raléi**. The two engage on missions together, and grow into a proper duo, up until what is now drafted as **RUDE REUNION**. After Rude Reunion, Raléi stumbles upon **Maria**, which kicks off the start of Act II. The focus now changed from Nils to Raléi and Maria, who partner up and gain intel to take down Dáritke once and for all. In the end, they manage to pick off the corners, but reach no success, which means the two women now have a target on their heads. Ultimately, the two try to sneak through the Álef Metro after being hunted down by various hitmen from Dáritke, but Maria's knowledge of the metro system is revealed to be outdated since she partnered up with the Agency. Dáritke had taken control of the metro station Álef-Nórem, which was the escape point for Raléi and Maria. Dáritke initiated a destruction protocol to have the metro station taken down with the two women inside, and through the deafeningly loud crunching of metal, only Maria makes it out alive, witnessing Raléi get buried under the steel structure after failing to save her. 

The Agency disbands shortly after. Their goals of helping the people in the fallen nations of Máneá was now left without its leader, and neither Nils, Omati, or Maria, wanted to take the risk of receiving a bounty on their head simply for taking Raléi's seat left vacant.
