# INSIGHT - Story
"**INSIGHT**" is a working title, and is subject to change. \
"**INSIGHT**" is set to follow *Amica Ferrháida*, Codename **Azure**.
## Concept
**Amica Ferrháida**, better known under her codename **Azure** due to her deep blue eyes, is an orphaned **Sirálian** Lupine (Leremkov) woman. At the age of 15, she already had plenty of experience with weaponry, and had been *fencing* since the age of 12, before picking up proper swordfighting from her 13th onwards. \
Her parents were both killed while en route to a mission in **Vao**. Even though her parents had done their best to hide their private lives from her at a young age, it was at the age of 14 that Amica learned that her parents were in fact *hitmen*, and had been doing this dangerous work far before she was even born. When she asked them, her dad claimed it was a *"Circuit they wish they could leave to raise her properly."*, but even so, on a fateful day in 2068, her parents did not come home on the agreed date, and she declared them MIA.

From thereon, Amica's life had lost all certainty. Now suddenly being orphaned, she picked up rebellious traits, and was soon seen regularly in fights at her school, ultimately leading to a denial into the college in **Mola** she had looked forward to studying in. From bad, it went to worse, and now having lost her only will to continue forward in life, one option remained: Vengeance for her parents, to tear the circuit down from inside out. And luckily, the Váiran subterrane in Máneá had a spot open just for her. 

Mission one was straightforward: From a dark alleyway, eliminate a target as they pass it, and having no other choice, Amica (Who was given the codename "Azure" due to the colour of her eyes) sets foot into the small city of Iárne equipped with a silenced pistol, with the only mission of killing a "loose end" of the Subterrane. And with her experience with various weaponry that she had acquired in her youth, the mission went with ease. Physically, at least. Mentally, it was the start of an avalanche of horrors.

*"The first kill fucks with you. Your body, your core, your head. It shakes every fibre in your body, and disturbs you all day and night long. Your 100th kill grants you a medal."* - Victoria (Windbreak) to Amica (Azure), about the hellish climate within the Subterrane.

Slowly and surely, the increasing number of assassination missions that Azure was sent on began to eat away the last ounces of her personality. Her routine numbed her senses. Deploy, eliminate, extract. Deploy, eliminate, extract. The blood spilled endlessly, the scars accumulating over every inch of her body, until the fateful *mission #184*, that not only left her with a scar right through her face, but also poisoned with the remains of Maxim's, her target's, **Ultima organ**, internally and specifically known as the **Flame Heart**. It left her physique demolished, and eventually became the main reason that strange, cryptic *swirls* began to accumulate from the very tips of her fingers, all the way to her left shoulder, spreading over to her shoulder blades the more she attempted to learn how this strange "gift" she received from Maxim worked. 

Unfortunately, it's during this process that Azure learns the root goal of the Subterrane: Halting any form of research, whether it's for good or bad causes. In secret, with the help of Windbreak, she discovers the profiles of every person she's killed in the past, followed by their killer, and the list of many people that were set to follow. Despite her collapsed mental health, it's Windbreak that manages to bring back some sense into Azure, and almost immediately, the two realise just what they've been a part of. 

*"You're fleeing?"* \
**"Should I stay instead? And continue to thin out those that did no wrong?"** \
*"Amica, let's-"* \
**"Don't-"** \
*"Let's do this last mission together. I can leave my post with more ease than you can."* \
Windbreak took a hold of Azure's left hand, its ink-black swirls having gotten more prominent over the last few days. She took a page at random from the stash of papers on the table before them, face down. \
*"I picked at random. Flip it around and read it aloud, we'll take it on together."* \
Azure complied, and with her right hand, she carefully flipped the paper around. \
**"Pahlatlán, Thórirsant. Affiliated with Carbine Industries."** \
*"Don't pause, you just started."* \
**"Limáida. She's Sirálian. I can't do that."** \
*"Then let me do it, Amica."* \
Windbreak gently squeezed Azure's hand, her thumb pressing against the black swirls on the back of her hand. \
*"We'll take on this mission together. And after this, we won't go back underground."* \
Azure gulped. \
**"Okay, Victoria."** She began, moving her right hand to press on top of Windbreak's hand. **"Let's get going, one last time."**

The aim is to segment the story into several segments, these being:
- **A regular mission** - To set the tone for what goes on within the Subterrane, and how this is handled within the underground and how Azure deals with this. 
- **Mission #184** - Not only is this the most important event during Azure's time within the Subterrane, it's where she is left with her "signature" scar that passes through her left eye, but most importantly, where she receives the remains of a **Flame Heart**. It should include a wind-up, where Azure approaches the destination. A climax, where the actual fight takes place, and where she ultimately receives the **Flame Heart** from Maxim in his own sacrifice. And lastly, a long wind-down, where Azure assesses what had happened after coming back to her senses, and eventually returning to the Subterrane to further wind-down in the company of Windbreak.
- **Mission #194** - Learning how to master her newfound ability that was granted to her by Maxim, she utilises the hidden power of the **Flame Heart**, and incinerates the body of her target in a manner completely new to her.
- **Mission #153 / #221** - Attempting to continue to live life like "normal", even now that she's been "cursed" with a power she still doesn't understand, she digs through the files that have been hidden within the Subterrane during maintenance together with Windbreak, only to discover the true cause and mission of the Subterrane: Eliminating all sorts of research from the face of the planet. In shock, Azure decides on the spot to abandon the Subterrane, as Windbreak helped her come to her senses, especially now that she too came to this conclusion. Together, they decide to pick out one last mission that they would embark on together, and never return from. This is Windbreak's 153rd, and Azure's 221st mission, and is set to eliminate a person vital in the resurgence of the lost Carbine Research Industries in Pahlatlán where once stood a nuclear fusion reactor: **Maria Limáida**.

### Where there's smoke
A knock on the door reverberated through the small office cubicle near the edge of the auditorium. It housed a one-way window, which allowed whoever was inside the office to view the outside, but not the other way around, which allowed the roughed-up man who stood inside a glimpse of who the knocks on the door belonged to. His eyes opened wide momentarily, recognising the rough, long, and abandoned hair that was only visible in the corner of the window, but already told him enough. His brows furrowed, and with a hand gesture, the door opened soon after, allowing the young woman opposite the door to come inside. *"You're seven minutes early."* He grunted, his back facing the woman as he adjusted his glasses, taking two sheets of paper from the desk before him before turning around once more. The look on the woman's face was neutral, but her slightly elevated speed at which she breathed was actively telling the man before her that she had been in a hurry. Her right hand was at her waist, her hand resting above a holstered pistol, which was still smoking slightly, which would slowly begin to fog up the small cubicle. **"Is being early a crime?"** She scoffed back, now resting on one leg to loosen up the other and letting it cool down more properly. Clearing his throat, the man adjusted his glasses once more, and read the words written on the sheets of paper in his hands aloud. *"Azure, please recite your mi-"* \
**"Codename Azure. In service since 2074. Mission #423, kill #717."** She immediately interrupted him, both of her hands now resting on her waist as she stood in an annoyed fashion. Her hair reached down to about halfway her chest, and despite having a mixture of grey and black colouring, it was mostly being neglected. It was even messier than the long beard that belonged to the man before her, who shared Azure's annoyed expression, which he followed up with a deep sigh. Taking a pen from the small pocket in his jeans, he refused to make eye contact with her, and simply wrote down the facts that he had just heard. *"The target's remains?"* \
**"Incinerated."** Azure smiled back, her eyes opening wide, and her hand returning to the pistol that was holstered on her right leg. **"Are more details necessary?"** She grinned, eyeing the man deeply, but his expression remained unchanged. *"No.."* He sighed in response. *"I'll make something up. Just head into the auditorium for now."* \
Azure's smile remained on her face, and letting go of the pistol holstered on her leg, she simply turned around once more and quickly closed the old door behind her. "Director Heyere", it said below the one-way glass, and in just a few seconds, Azure had already stepped far away from the office in the very corner. 

*//*

Through the masses of people, Azure swiftly and effortlessly navigated towards the very front of the auditorium. Every single person within this crowd was similar to herself, a cold-blooded killer, whose only way of making it through life normally was by taking it from others by force. *717* people, she had killed ruthlessly. The evidence burned to the ground, reduced to even less than ashes. From over these seven hundred kills, at least six hundred were left without evidence, eighty had gone cold from lack thereof, and the remaining twenty had an active case. But even those cases wouldn't surface properly, with every witness being simply next in line. \
Finding herself unable to navigate further through the crowd, her ears perked upright, filtering out the voice of the presenter on stage through the endless sea of other voices from the masses of people surrounding her. Like usual, a target was being laid on the table, and from within the crowd, anyone that was interested or willing enough to take up the mission would receive further information. But even though she'd missed the majority of their details, she raised her hand, pointing up her index and middle fingers, poking out of the seas of hair. It didn't take long for her to get noticed at the very front at the stage. *"Peace sign upfront. Codename, killcount."* The presenter simply requested, their eyes locking with Azure's, who kept her hand raised in the air. **"Codename Azure. 717."** She simply replied, grinning widely as the presenter's eyes opened wide at the absurd number. The enormous amount of people surrounding her suddenly quieted down as he repeated the killcount, every pair of eyes turning into her own direction, while hers remained fixated on the presenter. A momentary silence and pause filled the otherwise enormous auditorium, but clearing his voice, the presenter resumed, gesturing her to another office just outside the main hall, where she was to receive more information. Nodding once, she swiftly turned around, all eyes following her as she walked towards the exit. The mission was hers.

### Under four eyes
The quiet whistle of a bronze shell rushing piercing rapidly through the foggy air echoed through the alleys, but on the opposing end, the quiet whistle was soon followed by the much louder groan of a middle-aged man, which soon collapsed to the floor, his knees falling flat on the tiled floor, right into a puddle of water. A quick glance at his left foot revealed the source of the sudden fall, and the sudden sensation of a stinging, burning feeling spreading up from his toes to his shins. Another bullet found its way through the air, towards the man, now hitting him in his left arm, but reaching no further. Horrified, he looked to his left, not only hearing the sound of heavy boots heading towards his direction, but seeing the person that the gunshots belonged to rapidly approaching him. A dangerous expression was on her face, her eyes a bright, glowing blue, barely hidden by the enormous amount of black, grey, and white hair that decorated her soaked coat. But the horror in his eyes wasn't because of the gunshots, no, it was the smile on her face that horrified him. And now that he was immobile, he could only watch the woman approach him. *"N-.. No..!!"* He tried to cry out, but attempting to crawl away, he was unable to divert his eyes away from hers. Her right hand was still resting against her waist, the pistol that personally fired the two shells that were now embedded into his body held tightly in her hand, covered by a satin, red glove. Smoke was still seeping out of the silenced barrel all the way at the front. The grin remained on her face, and slowly, she raised her left hand to her lips, shushing him without saying a word, without making a noise. 

**"I'll be nice, I like your expression."** She suddenly whispered, having squatted down right beside the man, who was still in the same spot as before. His legs were soaked, having sat in the puddle this entire time, which was gradually turning a deeper and deeper red as his own blood mixed with the afternoon's rainfall. *"You.. W-wh..-"* \
**"Shhh. I'm in control."** She immediately interrupted the man, her fingers on her lips once more, while her other hand was still resting on the trigger. Any unprovoked action would immediately be punished, and with his heartrate faster than ever before, the man began to come to this realisation, too. No matter how much he'd try to resist or fight back, it would be to no avail. **"Director, your name?"** She grinned, the glow in her eyes persisting as they gazed deeply into those of the man. *"W-William.. William Craegh.."* He stammered back. \
**"What a unique name.."** The woman whispered back quietly, her head tilting slightly to the side as her eyes continued to deeply inspect William's expression. **"Do you go camping often, William?"** \
*"C-camping..?"* He quietly whispered back, taken aback by the sudden switchup in the conversation. His eyes were darting back and forth between the woman's eyes, and the pistol held tightly in her right hand. *"How.. How do you know..?"* \
**"There's a lot I know about you, William."** She grinned back once more, her smile getting scarily wide, horrifying William even further. A quiet sound of a charm that was fixated on her pistol's barrel gave him the shivers, catching him by surprise, but once more, he was allured by her eyes. **"But to me, you'll just be a number to me. You're #718."** She continued, looking directly into William's eyes. Her expression had gone from one akin to a psychopath to an extremely serious one in just a split second. Taking a quiet and quick breath, she stood back up, towering above him once more, gripping her pistol tightly in her hands, the texture of the pistol's grip digging into her palm through the glove. **"Say, William. Let's make a campfire here, shall we?"**

Her index finger travelled to the trigger on her pistol, and without much further thinking, the lights in the alleyway dimmed momentarily. Complete darkness filled the foggy and damp air that was levitating and stuffing the narrow hallway the two found themselves in. The only source of light, was a feint flash at the very end of her weapon's silenced barrel, followed by the quiet noise of William's lifeless body collapsing to the floor. A deep sigh exited her lips, and the lights in the alleyway jumped to life once more, revealing not just William's body, but a growing puddle of deep crimson blood surrounding him over time. **"Azure reporting. Target William Craegh eliminated."** She sighed into her earpiece, seemingly unaffected by the murder she had committed just now at all. Her left hand reached into her pocket, and took a sheet of paper, as well as a lighter. Holstering her pistol, she then took the lighter in her right hand, and with a quiet *flick*, a flame appeared, which soon burned away the corner of the paper, quickly spreading towards the three remaining edged. Without much further thought, she dropped the paper and let it float down towards William's body, whose shirt soon caught flames as well, spreading around to every single thread of his body. For a few seconds, she looked at the flames spreading to every inch of his body, even beginning to spread to the puddle of blood, incinerating and reducing every single atom that once belonged to him to mere ashes. It wasn't her first time, nor would it be her last. But one thing, she knew there was no denying. **"718th."** She whispered to herself, before turning around the alleyway once more.

## TWO - IN THE FLESH

## ?? - THE SCARS THAT MAKE YOU
Key points: 
- **Right hand**: Black ring on middle finger, **Scar on lower palm (#041)**, **Scar on upper palm, below knuckles (#127)**
- **Face**: **Scar through left eye (#184)**

### THE FIRE YOU IGNITE
The crackle of a communication device strapped to her left thigh told her enough. She was out of range, and yet, her target was much further down south than where she stood right now. In the midst of a thick forest, the dense roof made of leaves from all the century-old trees creating a blanket that prevented moonlight from illuminating the pathway before her. Her only means of travelling and reaching her target, her destination, was through the little puck on her thigh. But now, that option was gone, too, and she stood completely by herself. \
She sighed, and took two steps back, the crackle on the puck returning once more, and the earpiece strapped to her ear echoed its sound, leaving her closing her eyes in annoyance. The sound was deafening, and in the middle of nowhere, she was reliant on sound cues from any direction. If she couldn't adapt, she would become the prey, victim to anyone that might have intercepted the communications between herself and her commander, and intercept herself this way. Another two steps back, and the crackle disappeared, followed once more by pure silence. It didn't take long for it to be broken once more. *"Azure. We lost contact there. Do you read?"* The voice, although quiet, echoed from the puck, its signal transmitting forwards to her earpiece, which left her sighing in relief, but also in disgust to need to hear her commander's voice once more. Slowly and carefully, her left hand moved to the puck and snapped it off the clip wrapped around her thigh, and held it to her mouth. **"Azure. I'm reading. Two steps forward and I lose signal."** She sighed into the puck after pressing down a little button in its very centre. A moment of silence followed, until Azure's commander cleared his throat, and continued to speak once more. *"Right.."* He began, sighing deeply, seemingly lost at words as to what to do in this situation as well. A rumble could be heard in the background, but he was quick to slide this off as nothing, and continued. *"Azure. Recite the mission details. Once valid, you'll be on your own. We will await your return."* \
Azure sighed. **"Mission #184. Target is Maxim Veloire. Location is in the outskirts of Osselev, District Ald-Zselevcze. Target resides in overground, unbranded research facility. Objective is to eliminate the target, and incinerate the remains."** \
The puck crackled for another moment, even though Azure stood steadfast in the same spot. It followed by another moment of silence, before it was finally disturbed by Azure's commander for one last time. *"Mission greenlit. Make us proud, Azure."*

The very second the contact between then two was closed, Azure clicked the puck back on the clip on her thigh and immediately sprinted forward. Through the trees, she could already see the feint glow of a building, something akin to a warehouse, approach her as she neared it. The pistol that was holstered on her right leg was going back and worth as she sprinted, the sword attached to a sling around her waist was going up and down.
### YOUR SWORD IT FORGED
*// **Synopsis**: Azure's hidden "ability", or her signature means of execution, is a flame-wielding sword. Although she has never utilised its flames, which itself has barely been used in the first place as a pistol has almost always sufficed, the target that she is set to eliminate in Ald-Zselevcze has something else in mind. The two engage in a swordfight, and although the two both endure a fierce fight and weaken one another down, Azure eventually maintains the upper hand and successfully kills Maxim, piercing her blade cleanly through his chest and igniting it immediately after, allowing him a painful death by incineration. During this fight, Azure endures a blow to her face, **which is where she obtains her "signature" scar, that passes right through her eye**. With her left eye closed, but not bandaged at all, the warehouse itself is soon to follow and be swallowed whole by the flames. Despite the unaccounted for scale of the mission, Azure completes it as ordered, and returns once more to **Leth-Heléham**.*

### Snippets
A weak smile was on his face, which was the total opposite of the expression that dominated Azure's own face. Her brows were furrowed, while Maxim's own were weak, and getting even weaker by the second. The blood continued to seep out of his chest, finding its way past the blade that Azure had penetrated deeply through him. The heat of the flames that were surrounding them were picking up, droplets of sweat dripping down both of their foreheads. *"Amica.."* Maxim suddenly began, his voice weak, just like the his face, just like the rest of his body. With the last ounces of his strength, he lifted his right hand up, and placed it on top of the blade that was pierced into his chest. A pattern of blood swirls followed, and gradually rolled down the blade as he gripped it tightly, gritting his teeth. Azure's eyes opened wide, and tightened the grip on her sword once more, her scarred hands digging into the textured grip. **"You shouldn't know-"** \
*"Amica."* Maxim continued, interrupting Azure's confused, and worried voice. Amica was her real name, one that she hadn't heard in years, one that she hadn't used in years. How did Maxim know this name? What more did Maxim know about her past? Did he have a connection to the subterrane? Were her commander and Maxim aware that she was sent to kill him? \
*"Amica.. dear.."* He continued, his other hand now holding the sword's blade too, almost making it seem like he was planning to pull it out, or push it into his own chest even further. It worried Azure further and further, this was a situation she had never envisioned herself to be in. Using her sword was one oddity, but this situation, where her target was still alive even after receiving a fatal blow, was never briefed to her. Her ears were flat on her head, revealing her inner thoughts, her worries, and putting them on display for Maxim to see. *"I have.. questions left unanswered.."* Maxim coughed. *"Why you left Sirália, why you.. went underground.."* He coughed once more, his grip on Azure's sword weakening. *"Go on.. then.. Ferrháida. Play with fire."* 

In a sudden movement, Azure lost grip of her blade, as Maxim pushed it further into his own chest. The sheer strength that Maxim had suddenly gained surprised even Azure herself, someone who was renowned for her incredible reaction speeds. But that alone wasn't the sight that horrified her, and instead, it was the glow that was emitted from Maxim's chest that made her heart sink. His smile grew wider and wider by the second, as if the sheer pain of the Azure's blade slicing past his flesh, through his lungs, wasn't enough to have him stop. Their eyes met, and in his eyes, Azure could see nothing but all of Maxim's last hopes, last determinations, last *mission* of his, stored entirely within those wide-open irises. Even her, it horrified. **"Maxim.. you.."** She could only stammer, and hesitantly, she leaned forward, trying to regain control of her blade, to pull it out of her target once more, if he still was her target at all, that is. **"This.. what is..-"** \
*"A Flame Heart."* Maxim interrupted her, blood seeping past his teeth, past his lips, down to his chin and soon dripping onto the steel blade whose temperature continued to rise exponentially. His hands were glowing orange, gradually beginning to blind her, as she squinted her eyes to protect herself from going blind. By the second, the situation became more and more unreal to her. *"This is what the subterrane feared, Amica."* Maxim continued, his breathing getting rougher with every sentence. If his minutes weren't numbered yet, he absolutely was on his last legs now. *"This is why the subterrane wants me dead, Amica."* He grunted, and slowly, his left hand left the blade once more and reached out to Azure's face. Its brightly luminescent fingers caressing the scars on her neck, a scar on her right cheek, and even though the heat of Maxim's hands made her fear second-degree burns, she was stunlocked in place, and could only witness the bizarre situation unfold before her. His clothes were burning away, and from his fingertips, a swirly pattern of the same orange glow revealed itself to her. *"They feared the Heart's potential in me, Amica."* He continued, his eyes squinted as his right hand was now held tightly as the very start of the blade, nearly pressing against the grip. *"So be it yours, Amica Ferrháida."*

Gritting his teeth, Maxim gripped he blade tightly in his hand, blood streaming out of his hand as it sliced open his fingers at ease. With a deep, coarse breath, he pulled Azure's sword back out of his chest, grunting loudly as it sliced past his lungs, his flesh, his bones, and skin once more, before it was freed into the open air for the first time in minutes. Azure's eyes were wide open, her ears folded flat on her head. In all her missions since she left Sirália, since she was welcomed into the subterrane, in every single one of the missions she'd gone through, or the stories from her fellow hitmen, none were as insane as what she was witnessing before her very eyes right now. **"Maxim.. are you even human at all..?"** She stammered, finding herself on the receiving end of her own sword, which to her horror, was coated in a frantic fire. A grin formed on his face once more, and while his grip on Azure's sword was tight, it was weak, yet enough to deal a fatal blow in the same fashion that she had given Maxim. It would mean it'd go straight through her chest, and with a fire to accompany the forged steel, it would either be instant, or incredibly painful to be on the receiving end of such a blow. \
Instead, Maxim snickered. *"The lupine lady asks if I'm human."* He laughed, tilting the sword by 45 degrees, taking an attacking stance while his legs were severely weakened. A blow would be painful, but it would no longer be fatal. *"Amica. It's futile."*

A quick slash followed, slicing across Azure's face diagonally, going through her left eye. Her hands flung to her face to cover the freshly created would, a sharp, stinging sensation immediately rushing all over her face as she pressed against it, feeling it burn, the heat of the blade persistent on her own flesh. It would leave a scar, and it would not look pretty. \
*"Amica Ferrháida."* Maxim continued, and while Azure couldn't see his expression, it was as stern as it could possibly be. He was truly on his last legs, and anything that would follow, would be the last thing he'd ever to before his inevitable death. The blood loss had been immense, and the adrenaline in his veins had run out by now. Another deep and coarse breath followed, and the quiet sound of the soles of his shoes adjusting on the concrete floor beneath her told Azure enough. He was taking a new stance. With her heart pounding in her chest, she looked back once more to Maxim's determined expression, his lethal stance, and before she had any time to react, she could only look at her own sword darting towards her. *"So be it yours."*
### A Flame Heart
*// Seemingly immediately, Azure comes back to her senses and finds herself in the research facility once more. The fire had dissipated, but the heat in the atmosphere of the auditorium that she had just fought her target, Maxim in, remains. The scar on her eye remains prominent, which she can see in the reflection on a chrome wall, but to her surprise, Maxim was nowhere to be found. Memories flash back into her head. Her sword was within Maxim's chest, before he pulled it out at ease, and eventually ignited it to then pierce it into her own chest? In a hurry, she checks herself, but sees no evident flesh wound apart from the one on her face and her left shoulder. But a strange pattern **did** appear on her shoulder, which passed down all the way to her left hand. It's a pattern similar to the one she saw on Maxim's arm.*

*// The pattern is part of an **Ultima Anomaly**, which is provided by the fact that somehow, Azure is now in possession of the **Flame Heart**. She presumes that somehow, Maxim had offered himself as he was on death's door regardless.* \
*// This is **extremely broad** and requires a **lot** of foundation to properly work this out. This may be subject to change in the near and far future.*
