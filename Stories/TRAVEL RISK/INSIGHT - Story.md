### Where there's smoke
A knock on the door reverberated through the small office cubicle near the edge of the auditorium. It housed a one-way window, which allowed whoever was inside the office to view the outside, but not the other way around, which allowed the roughed-up man who stood inside a glimpse of who the knocks on the door belonged to. His eyes opened wide momentarily, recognising the rough, long, and abandoned hair that was only visible in the corner of the window, but already told him enough. His brows furrowed, and with a hand gesture, the door opened soon after, allowing the young woman opposite the door to come inside. *"You're seven minutes early."* He grunted, his back facing the woman as he adjusted his glasses, taking two sheets of paper from the desk before him before turning around once more. The look on the woman's face was neutral, but her slightly elevated speed at which she breathed was actively telling the man before her that she had been in a hurry. Her right hand was at her waist, her hand resting above a holstered pistol, which was still smoking slightly, which would slowly begin to fog up the small cubicle. **"Is being early a crime?"** She scoffed back, now resting on one leg to loosen up the other and letting it cool down more properly. Clearing his throat, the man adjusted his glasses once more, and read the words written on the sheets of paper in his hands aloud. *"Azure, please recite your mi-"* \
**"Codename Azure. In service since 2074. Mission #423, kill #717."** She immediately interrupted him, both of her hands now resting on her waist as she stood in an annoyed fashion. Her hair reached down to about halfway her chest, and despite having a mixture of grey and black colouring, it was mostly being neglected. It was even messier than the long beard that belonged to the man before her, who shared Azure's annoyed expression, which he followed up with a deep sigh. Taking a pen from the small pocket in his jeans, he refused to make eye contact with her, and simply wrote down the facts that he had just heard. *"The target's remains?"* \
**"Incinerated."** Azure smiled back, her eyes opening wide, and her hand returning to the pistol that was holstered on her right leg. **"Are more details necessary?"** She grinned, eyeing the man deeply, but his expression remained unchanged. *"No.."* He sighed in response. *"I'll make something up. Just head into the auditorium for now."* \
Azure's smile remained on her face, and letting go of the pistol holstered on her leg, she simply turned around once more and quickly closed the old door behind her. "Director Heyere", it said below the one-way glass, and in just a few seconds, Azure had already stepped far away from the office in the very corner.

Through the masses of people, Azure swiftly and effortlessly navigated towards the very front of the auditorium. Every single person within this crowd was similar to herself, a cold-blooded killer, whose only way of making it through life normally was by taking it from others by force. *717* people, she had killed ruthlessly. The evidence burned to the ground, reduced to even less than ashes. From over these seven hundred kills, at least six hundred were left without evidence, eighty had gone cold from lack thereof, and the remaining twenty had an active case. But even those cases wouldn't surface properly, with every witness being simply next in line. \
Finding herself unable to navigate further through the crowd, her ears perked upright, filtering out the voice of the presenter on stage through the endless sea of other voices from the masses of people surrounding her. Like usual, a target was being laid on the table, and from within the crowd, anyone that was interested or willing enough to take up the mission would receive further information. But even though she'd missed the majority of their details, she raised her hand, pointing up her index and middle fingers, poking out of the seas of hair. It didn't take long for her to get noticed at the very front at the stage. *"Peace sign upfront. Codename, killcount."* The presenter simply requested, their eyes locking with Azure's, who kept her hand raised in the air. **"Codename Azure. 717."** She simply replied, grinning widely as the presenter's eyes opened wide at the absurd number. The enormous amount of people surrounding her suddenly quieted down as he repeated the killcount, every pair of eyes turning into her own direction, while hers remained fixated on the presenter. A momentary silence and pause filled the otherwise enormous auditorium, but clearing his voice, the presenter resumed, gesturing her to another office just outside the main hall, where she was to receive more information. Nodding once, she swiftly turned around, all eyes following her as she walked towards the exit. The mission was hers.
