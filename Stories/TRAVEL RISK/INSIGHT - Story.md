### Where there's smoke
A knock on the door reverberated through the small office cubicle near the edge of the auditorium. It housed a one-way window, which allowed whoever was inside the office to view the outside, but not the other way around, which allowed the roughed-up man who stood inside a glimpse of who the knocks on the door belonged to. His eyes opened wide momentarily, recognising the rough, long, and abandoned hair that was only visible in the corner of the window, but already told him enough. His brows furrowed, and with a hand gesture, the door opened soon after, allowing the young woman opposite the door to come inside. *"You're seven minutes early."* He grunted, his back facing the woman as he adjusted his glasses, taking two sheets of paper from the desk before him before turning around once more. The look on the woman's face was neutral, but her slightly elevated speed at which she breathed was actively telling the man before her that she had been in a hurry. Her right hand was at her waist, her hand resting above a holstered pistol, which was still smoking slightly, which would slowly begin to fog up the small cubicle. **"Is being early a crime?"** She scoffed back, now resting on one leg to loosen up the other and letting it cool down more properly. Clearing his throat, the man adjusted his glasses once more, and read the words written on the sheets of paper in his hands aloud. *"Azure, please recite your mi-"* \
**"Codename Azure. In service 2075. Mission #423, kill #717."** She immediately interrupted him, both of her hands now resting on her waist as she stood in an annoyed fashion. Her hair reached down to about halfway her chest, and despite having a mixture of grey and black colouring, it was mostly being neglected. It was even messier than the long beard that belonged to the man before her, who shared Azure's annoyed expression, which he followed up with a deep sigh. Taking a pen from the small pocket in his jeans, he refused to make eye contact with her, and simply wrote down the facts that he had just heard. *"The target's remains?"* \
**"Incinerated."** Azure smiled back, her eyes opening wide, and her hand returning to the pistol that was holstered on her right leg. **"Are more details necessary?"** She grinned, eyeing the man deeply, but his expression remained unchanged. *"No.."* He sighed in response. *"I'll make something up. Just head into the auditorium for now."*
