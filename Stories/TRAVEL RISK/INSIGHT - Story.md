### Where there's smoke
A knock on the door reverberated through the small office cubicle near the edge of the auditorium. It housed a one-way window, which allowed whoever was inside the office to view the outside, but not the other way around, which allowed the roughed-up man who stood inside a glimpse of who the knocks on the door belonged to. His eyes opened wide momentarily, recognising the rough, long, and abandoned hair that was only visible in the corner of the window, but already told him enough. His brows furrowed, and with a hand gesture, the door opened soon after, allowing the young woman opposite the door to come inside. *"You're seven minutes early."* He grunted, his back facing the woman as he adjusted his glasses, taking two sheets of paper from the desk before him before turning around once more. The look on the woman's face was neutral, but her slightly elevated speed at which she breathed was actively telling the man before her that she had been in a hurry. Her right hand was at her waist, her hand resting above a holstered pistol, which was still smoking slightly, which would slowly begin to fog up the small cubicle. **"Is being early a crime?"** She scoffed back, now resting on one leg to loosen up the other and letting it cool down more properly. Clearing his throat, the man adjusted his glasses once more, and read the words written on the sheets of paper in his hands aloud. *"Azure, please recite your mi-"* \
**"Codename Azure. In service since 2074. Mission #423, kill #717."** She immediately interrupted him, both of her hands now resting on her waist as she stood in an annoyed fashion. Her hair reached down to about halfway her chest, and despite having a mixture of grey and black colouring, it was mostly being neglected. It was even messier than the long beard that belonged to the man before her, who shared Azure's annoyed expression, which he followed up with a deep sigh. Taking a pen from the small pocket in his jeans, he refused to make eye contact with her, and simply wrote down the facts that he had just heard. *"The target's remains?"* \
**"Incinerated."** Azure smiled back, her eyes opening wide, and her hand returning to the pistol that was holstered on her right leg. **"Are more details necessary?"** She grinned, eyeing the man deeply, but his expression remained unchanged. *"No.."* He sighed in response. *"I'll make something up. Just head into the auditorium for now."* \
Azure's smile remained on her face, and letting go of the pistol holstered on her leg, she simply turned around once more and quickly closed the old door behind her. "Director Heyere", it said below the one-way glass, and in just a few seconds, Azure had already stepped far away from the office in the very corner. 

*//*

Through the masses of people, Azure swiftly and effortlessly navigated towards the very front of the auditorium. Every single person within this crowd was similar to herself, a cold-blooded killer, whose only way of making it through life normally was by taking it from others by force. *717* people, she had killed ruthlessly. The evidence burned to the ground, reduced to even less than ashes. From over these seven hundred kills, at least six hundred were left without evidence, eighty had gone cold from lack thereof, and the remaining twenty had an active case. But even those cases wouldn't surface properly, with every witness being simply next in line. \
Finding herself unable to navigate further through the crowd, her ears perked upright, filtering out the voice of the presenter on stage through the endless sea of other voices from the masses of people surrounding her. Like usual, a target was being laid on the table, and from within the crowd, anyone that was interested or willing enough to take up the mission would receive further information. But even though she'd missed the majority of their details, she raised her hand, pointing up her index and middle fingers, poking out of the seas of hair. It didn't take long for her to get noticed at the very front at the stage. *"Peace sign upfront. Codename, killcount."* The presenter simply requested, their eyes locking with Azure's, who kept her hand raised in the air. **"Codename Azure. 717."** She simply replied, grinning widely as the presenter's eyes opened wide at the absurd number. The enormous amount of people surrounding her suddenly quieted down as he repeated the killcount, every pair of eyes turning into her own direction, while hers remained fixated on the presenter. A momentary silence and pause filled the otherwise enormous auditorium, but clearing his voice, the presenter resumed, gesturing her to another office just outside the main hall, where she was to receive more information. Nodding once, she swiftly turned around, all eyes following her as she walked towards the exit. The mission was hers.

### Under four eyes
The quiet whistle of a bronze shell rushing piercing rapidly through the foggy air echoed through the alleys, but on the opposing end, the quiet whistle was soon followed by the much louder groan of a middle-aged man, which soon collapsed to the floor, his knees falling flat on the tiled floor, right into a puddle of water. A quick glance at his left foot revealed the source of the sudden fall, and the sudden sensation of a stinging, burning feeling spreading up from his toes to his shins. Another bullet found its way through the air, towards the man, now hitting him in his left arm, but reaching no further. Horrified, he looked to his left, not only hearing the sound of heavy boots heading towards his direction, but seeing the person that the gunshots belonged to rapidly approaching him. A dangerous expression was on her face, her eyes a bright, glowing blue, barely hidden by the enormous amount of black, grey, and white hair that decorated her soaked coat. But the horror in his eyes wasn't because of the gunshots, no, it was the smile on her face that horrified him. And now that he was immobile, he could only watch the woman approach him. *"N-.. No..!!"* He tried to cry out, but attempting to crawl away, he was unable to divert his eyes away from hers. Her right hand was still resting against her waist, the pistol that personally fired the two shells that were now embedded into his body held tightly in her hand, covered by a satin, red glove. Smoke was still seeping out of the silenced barrel all the way at the front. The grin remained on her face, and slowly, she raised her left hand to her lips, shushing him without saying a word, without making a noise. 

**"I'll be nice, I like your expression."** She suddenly whispered, having squatted down right beside the man, who was still in the same spot as before. His legs were soaked, having sat in the puddle this entire time, which was gradually turning a deeper and deeper red as his own blood mixed with the afternoon's rainfall. *"You.. W-wh..-"* \
**"Shhh. I'm in control."** She immediately interrupted the man, her fingers on her lips once more, while her other hand was still resting on the trigger. Any unprovoked action would immediately be punished, and with his heartrate faster than ever before, the man began to come to this realisation, too. No matter how much he'd try to resist or fight back, it would be to no avail. **"Director, your name?"** She grinned, the glow in her eyes persisting as they gazed deeply into those of the man. *"W-William.. William Craegh.."* He stammered back. \
**"What a unique name.."** The woman whispered back quietly, her head tilting slightly to the side as her eyes continued to deeply inspect William's expression. **"Do you go camping often, William?"** \
*"C-camping..?"* He quietly whispered back, taken aback by the sudden switchup in the conversation. His eyes were darting back and forth between the woman's eyes, and the pistol held tightly in her right hand. *"How.. How do you know..?"* \
**"There's a lot I know about you, William."** She grinned back once more, her smile getting scarily wide, horrifying William even further. A quiet sound of a charm that was fixated on her pistol's barrel gave him the shivers, catching him by surprise, but once more, he was allured by her eyes. **"But to me, you'll just be a number to me. You're #718."** She continued, looking directly into William's eyes. Her expression had gone from one akin to a psychopath to an extremely serious one in just a split second. Taking a quiet and quick breath, she stood back up, towering above him once more, gripping her pistol tightly in her hands, the texture of the pistol's grip digging into her palm through the glove. **"Say, William. Let's make a campfire here, shall we?"**

Her index finger travelled to the trigger on her pistol, and without much further thinking, the lights in the alleyway dimmed momentarily. Complete darkness filled the foggy and damp air that was levitating and stuffing the narrow hallway the two found themselves in. The only source of light, was a feint flash at the very end of her weapon's silenced barrel, followed by the quiet noise of William's lifeless body collapsing to the floor. A deep sigh exited her lips, and the lights in the alleyway jumped to life once more, revealing not just William's body, but a growing puddle of deep crimson blood surrounding him over time. **"Azure reporting. Target William Craegh eliminated."** She sighed into her earpiece, seemingly unaffected by the murder she had committed just now at all. Her left hand reached into her pocket, and took a sheet of paper, as well as a lighter. Holstering her pistol, she then took the lighter in her right hand, and with a quiet *flick*, a flame appeared, which soon burned away the corner of the paper, quickly spreading towards the three remaining edged. Without much further thought, she dropped the paper and let it float down towards William's body, whose shirt soon caught flames as well, spreading around to every single thread of his body. For a few seconds, she looked at the flames spreading to every inch of his body, even beginning to spread to the puddle of blood, incinerating and reducing every single atom that once belonged to him to mere ashes. It wasn't her first time, nor would it be her last. But one thing, she knew there was no denying. **"718th."** She whispered to herself, before turning around the alleyway once more.
