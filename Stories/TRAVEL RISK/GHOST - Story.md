# GHOST - Story
**Mika Andzákin**, **Dáritke**'s prodigy and also known as *The Ghost*: A stealth netrunner that has been working for Dáritke for as long as he could remember. Despite his exposed and colourful neurotech accentuating the majority of his body, his signature is that he remains out of sight, and travels through towers and streets as if he were a *ghost*, unseen by the majority. 

## To The Top
### Watch your steps
*// POV: Mika* \
*// Ódóni Industries, Álef*

*"Floor 3. Server room A6D. Vault 35. Tray 12. Neurokicks are there. Extract the tray. Watch your step. Good luck."*

**"The usual."** I think to myself, as I lock my phone, seeing my masked face in the reflection. It wasn't the prettiest of designs, but the yellow lines on the mask did differentiate me from the others. It wasn't an oddity for people like me to wear simple scarfs or masks while on a mission like this, but it was more than important to know just who you're up against. *Dáritke* wore yellow, the *Agency* would usually wear cyan or turquoise, and the police would always show up in black and silver. The second you see silver shimmer in the corner of your eye, it's already be too late. 

Putting my phone in my pocket, I check my pistol in the other, feeling its heat even through the glove I was wearing. It were experimental weapons, but they served their purpose: Harmless takedowns. *"Keep your weapons armed and warmed"* was always said before missions, *"You don't want that failing on you in combat."* Shaking my head, and gently slapping my own cheeks to keep myself awake and focused, I gradually make my way up the tower to the third floor. I was in the garbage disposal area, where cameras were limited. Having done a similar mission a couple of times before, it wasn't tough for me to break my way into the tower, picking the electronic lock with ease, simply by tapping my wrist against it. That by itself isn't something most runners do, because you don't know how much a surgery like that would impact you, but it was a given for me. I've been doing such missions since I was young, picking locks and backdoors with electronics and neurotech, so it was an easy choice to make, and a way for me to further develop any sorts of skills I had acquired, and those that lay before me would be even easier to achieve.

Nevertheless, I quietly closed the door behind me, and put on the slim earpiece from my bag that was given to me. Taking out a stopwatch as well, I took a deep breath, and pressed start on the timer, whispering **"Entry successful. Quiet steps now."** into the earpiece as a means of a log, before quietly making my way up to the third floor. 

Before long, I'd made my way to the third floor without getting noticed, and entered the server room I had to be in, keeping the door open behind me as a means of easily remembering where to exit from again. **"Vault 35.. Tray 12.. 35.. 12.."** I muttered to myself, double checking very noise that echoed through the surprisingly quiet server room, in hopes that there'd be no security check right at this very moment. They always happen hourly, and if timed right, I could empty this entire tray into my bag and make my way out even quicker than I entered. Taking a deep, but quiet breath, I open the server rack the same way I opened the backdoor, and quietly opened the huge, glass panel that kept every Neurokick sealed away securely, as far as "secure" goes, anyway. I counted the trays once more, ending at tray 12. and carefully placed every Neurokick that was on top of it in the backpack. It seemed easy enough, but something felt very off about just *how easy* this was going. Neurokicks shouldn't be this easily accessible, the fact I made my way to A6D was already quiet enough, and I made sure to avoid cameras, but at this point I became excessively nervous. Did I miss a camera? Are my ears failing me? I didn't bother thinking too deeply into what *could* happen, and put the last two Neurokicks in my back, keeping my focus on what *is* happening. 

Quietly zipping my bag up, I make my way back to the door where I had initially come from, only to find it closed again. **"Hadn't I kept that open..?"** I think to myself, ticked off far enough to rest my hand on my pistol, ready to confront anything that would step in front of my path to the exit, the weight of the Neurokicks noticeably pulling me down to the floor. The heat of the pistol was still prominent through my glove, I take it out of the holster, and start to walk around the server room. My senses told me that there was someone present in this very room, and had somehow entered without me hearing it. But, with hearing like mine, how?

*"Dumb fucking dog."*

A gunshot grazed my ear, and I immediately fired back across the aisle, nearly tripping over my own steps while more gunshots fly past me. I make my way behind one of the server racks, barely managing to scramble together another battery and figuring out how many shots I had left. 25 in total. I could fence this guy off with that. Fully aware that I was short on time, I checked my bag in a hasty manner, making sure to keep the Neurokicks safe, while equipping a simple old-school flashbang as well. 

*"Your steps aren't silent enough, not even your own ears pick it up. A flashbang most definitely won't help you keep quiet."* I heard the man giggle from nearby, much closer than I'd liked him to be. Once more, I realise that I hadn't heard him at all. He entered the room without any sound, and now stepped towards me without a single sound either. Was this guy supernatural? This seemed impossible. Taking a deep breath, hoping that it'd be quiet enough, I fire two shots to my left and toss the flashbang to my right. After a moment, the flashbang goes off, the noise of the blast giving me enough time to climb on top of the server racks and subsequently track the guard to take him down. I keep my pistol drawn, its heat still burning through my glove, giving me worries that I might have already overheated it from those few shots. Even then, my finger remained on the trigger, disregarding any disciplines I was taught, but knowing this pistol couldn't harm someone lethally, I couldn't be bothered anymore.

My finger immediately draws to the trigger and instinctively aims to my back, hearing a single step and a quiet laugh as I carefully take a step backwards myself, away from his sounds. Any sort of trust I had in my own hearing was lost, especially with how weirdly this guard was moving between his positions from one moment into the other. I had 23 shots left, which should grant me enough ways to escape and keep myself safe, but I continued to hold my finger on the trigger, making no premature actions until I felt like I had no other options but to shoot. Keeping my pistol aimed at wherever his sounds were coming from, I started to scan around the room from above the server racks, locating and finding exits that could pose a safe way for me to extract. My eyes land on a stairwell at the edge of the server room, which would be about a 100 metre run. 

Lost in my thoughts, I once more failed to notice where the guard had moved, only to get reminded by a bullet that had hit my right lower leg. Losing my balance, I tip over and desperately try to break my fall from the server racks, already having lost where the shot even came from. I grinded my teeth in pain, wasting no time in wrapping a bandage around the wound, knowing that I was completely out of time, and had to make my way out, immediately. \
*"For a runner, it seems your journey ends here. Wounded, like prey."* \
I was starting to get sick of this guy's voice. \
*"And it seems like you are clueless as to what kind of predator you're up against."* \
Having had enough, I quit thinking rationally and pulled two pins, one smoke grenade, one decoy grenade, and responded snarkily before running off. \
**"You seem to be clueless about what you're guarding. Find a new job."**

Fighting through my wounds, I fired five more shots through the smoke that had filled the aisle, and ran for my life. The cybernetics that were put into my body many years ago finally fired up, giving me the strength I needed to deal with the gunshot wound for the time being. With adrenaline surging through my veins, I felt faster than ever before. Making my way to the door, I shoot twice before me and twice behind me, destroying the terminal and forcing the door to open while sprinting towards it. **"The things I do for Dáritke.."** I mumble to myself, making my way out the door and descending three floors as fast as I could. Tapping my earpiece, I breathe heavily, struggling to properly create a highlight for the log as I stumble over my own words. **"A6D.. 32 12.. acquired-. Hostile activity.."** I manage to spurt out while clumsily reaching for Vikram's contact details on my earpiece, dialling him immediately after.

*"Mika! Great to hear you! How's th-"* \
**"No time, Vikram. Neurokicks acquired, shots fired, find me an escape."** \
Clearing his throat, Vikram takes a second to collect his thoughts and get a glimpse of the situation, immediately adjusting to the sudden change of pace. \
*"Álef metro. Enter at Ald Nódori. Exit at Egórecë. We'll await you there. Departs every 5."*
**"Egórecë? Are you insane?"** \
*"Listen, Mika. Do you want to live, or do you want to die on the way out? I don't care that you cross through Kristánisin, The Agency won't have interest in you anyway. Just go, next in 4."* \
I shook my head, taking a deep breath upon reaching the ground floor while the sirens in the building became louder with every second. \
**"Copy. Locking down and extracting. See you in Egórecë."**

### Code 5
*// POV: Mika* \
*// Metro da Máneá, Egórecë*

*Nest halt: Egórecë. Sette Metro fortsettést di: Egórecë-Júgul, Osselev, i Bwiskvá.* \
With stress refusing to leave my body, I nervously pressed the marked *"HALT"* button on one of the pillars in the metro. Ever since transferring at Álef, I felt like I was continuously being watched, and the adrenaline that my neurotech continued to produce and pump into my veins didn't help in the slightest either. Vikram had told me that passing through Kristánisin wouldn't be a problem, but even so, I couldn't help but worry that The Agency would still attempt to capture me, whatever their motive might be. \
Finally, the metro came to a halt at the once beautifully decorated metro station of Egórece, which had deteriorated even further in the past couple of years. The upkeep of the stations was terrible, the only stations that didn't look like a mess were those of the capitals and airports, and Egórece wasn't either of those. With a deep sigh, I put my scarf back over my mouth, the yellow stripes making their appearance again. While the markings helped me to stand out for Vikram to easily spot me, it also make me an easy target for any other agency that had put money on me to collect their bounty in a mere second.

With my heart pounding in my chest and adrenaline surging through my veins, I held the straps of my backpack with the Neurokicks tightly, making sure I wouldn't be able to lose it. Looking around frantically for any threats or suspicious people, I feel a slight tingle go through my legs, as if my neurotech sensed a threat in the distance and prepared my body to flee. But even then, I made my way up to the stairs as calmly as I could while the quiet whine of the metro departing veers off into the tunnel at the end of the station. The feeling of being watched refused to exit my mind, and I started to look around the station even more nervously as the feeling that I was being watched and hunted increased tenfold. 

Tapping my earpiece, I contacted Vikram, updating him on my whereabouts and where the extraction would be. \
*"Mika! I take it you're in Egórecë?"* \
I nodded, whispering back quietly while walking through the hallways of the metro station, doing my best to not stand out: **"I have, making my way to the exit now, feeling like I'm being watched. Can you confirm?"** \
*"Cannot right now, Mika."* Vikram replied almost immediately. *"I'm afraid we have uninvited guests over at Egórecë too, so details are limited."* \
**"Understood, code 5?"** \
*"Correct! Take to the skies, as they say!"* Vikram replied, immediately breaking the connection right after as I made my way towards the exit. "Take to the skies" was what Dáritke understood as "Code 5", which was one of the emergency escapes they had established when Dáritke was first approached by the police many years ago. The goal was simple on paper: Reach the top of Hád Bésim Tower, and a helicopter will pick you up there. In practice, it's not as easy as it sounds. Hád Bésim is a tower with 70 floors, and even for a runner like me, that takes an extreme toll on you. And to make matters worse, it's also heavily guarded by police. 

I shook my head, taking the stairs to exit the Metro station, and immediately looked to the sky to see Hád Bésim tower above me. I sighed deeply, fastening my backpack extra tightly as I made my way towards the tower, forming my plan to enter and reach the top once more.

### Drafted Story: Take To The Skies
*// POV: Mika* \
*// Hád Bésim Tower, Egórecë*

**Drafted**: Attempting a similar entry and climb that he took in the Ódóni tower, Mika makes his way through the floors of the Hád Bésim tower, but with much more drawbacks and confrontations. The police is present on every floor, guarding almost every angle. With this in mind, Mika considers climbing the tower from the outside, but ends up sneaking into a broken elevator shaft instead, doing all he can to avoid the police, and getting caught.

### Drafted
Tapping my left shoulder, I felt a surge of adrenaline go through my veins. Closely inspecting the flow of blue liquid rushing through my arm, it shined brightly in the darkening sky. It was almost 9pm, the sun was beginning to set and the natural light was beginning to drop. With another tap, the glow of the liquid dimmed, and vanished altogether, and my cloak activated. **"Out of sight.."** I whispered to myself, carefully stepping towards the back of the tower, and finding another locked door near the garbage disposal. Just like the Ódóni tower, surveillance here was low, but I couldn't take any further risks. I had already gone through Kristánisin, took the public metro, and yet, Vikram said that I was actively being watched, so I couldn't risk being seen by anyone, anywhere.

Inspecting the terminal on the lock next to the locked garbage door, I raised my wrist, the orange glow already appearing as the rabbit recognised a lock mechanism. With a dimmed flash, the terminal's screen disabled for a moment, and the door opened by itself. **"Easy enough."** I scoffed to myself, looking around me once more to check for any cameras that I might have missed, but luckily, I made my way through just fine. But quietly closing the door behind me, the next set of issues became clear to me. My eyes locked onto a camera feed that hung above the door I had just closed, which cycled between the various camera feeds throughout the tower. One thing seemed to repeat itself no matter the camera: The walls were dressed in white and gold, and police was present everywhere. I sighed deeply, my cloak was beginning to expire already, and needed a recharge somewhere safe. Without much further thought, I tucked myself behind a bookshelf, and took a deep breath. The walls were fairly thin, and I could easily hear people walking past. Some were talking about everyday topics, about business, but others were definitely talking about the elevated police presence here right now. I let out another deep breath, disabling the cloak, and letting it recharge for a moment while coming up with a way to reach the top of the tower.
