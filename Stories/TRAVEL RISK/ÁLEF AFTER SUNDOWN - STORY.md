*// The below snippet is the original drafted synopsis for this story. However, the actually drafted story does not yet match. The synopsis is subject to change.*

## TRAVEL RISK - Álef After Sundown
The deals come out at night, hidden in the alleys of **Álef**. Its automated transport system makes frequent travel between trading hotspots a breeze, and **Maria** knows this by heart. In an attempted interception of a trade, she comes in contact with **Raléi**, from **The Agency**, and the two agree on a ceasefire for the time being, and to combine their strengths to figure out who is intercepting their respective trades. Despite not being part of an agency, **Maria** is especially skilled in close-quarters combat, and looks are especially deceiving with her build. 

### Drafted Story
*"Why raise your weapon? You don't know me."*  
  
The woman quietly chuckled, showing no signs of fear despite facing down the barrel of a pistol. Her hair was short, but wavy, round glasses decorated her otherwise pale face, resting on her nose just above her freckles. She didn't appear like a person that excelled in a combat situation that she found herself in, but even so, her guard wouldn't go down.  
  
**"Don't play games, I've seen you intercept that briefcase."** The booming voice of the man replied, bouncing against the narrow walls in the alleyway they found themselves in. Looking down the short barrel of his pistol, the woman before him raised her arms, shrugging in response. *"I've no clue what you're on about."* She began, looking around her, below her, behind her. *"You clearly know what you're looking for, but I don't see it. Where's this briefcase you desperately want, then?"*  
  
Instead of a loud voice, the sound of a loud bang now passed through the alley, echoing and dissipating into the openness of the adjacent streets. But no sound follows, and the bang of the pistol fades away into the distance. The man's eyes opened widely, dumbfounded at the sight before him. Through the iron sights, he was aiming right at the forehead of the woman he was facing. But after firing, his pistol stayed in the same place, facing the exact same position, but she was now standing a metre to the left. In under a second, she must have moved, or he must have had a shiver go through his body to miss the shot.  
  
*"Tch. All of you are the same."* She scoffed, biting her nail, her expression having changed from being neutral to clearly being annoyed. The man with the pistol stayed frozen in place, struggling, no, completely unable to process the absurdity of what he just witnessed. He opens his mouth, trying to express his mind, but finds himself short on words. The briefcase he saw her running with just moments ago had vanished out of sight, and that is already disregarding the fact she managed to dodge a bullet, a bullet!  
  
*"I'll take my leave, if you have nothing to say."* She sighed. The man lowered his pistol in defeat, his finger leaving the trigger. **"H-How.. do you do.. such things?"** He stammered, his eyes following the figure of the woman that was walking past him, now having stopped beside him. She smirked, her crimson eyes gazing him directly into his soul as she formulated her reply with a smug expression on her face. *"You're slow, and you're predictable. Two steps separate us. You're one step behind, and I'm one ahead."* She laughed, breaking the staredown as she continued forward to walk out of the alley, into the open street.  
  
*"Do me a favour. Tell Mitch that Maria is in Álef. He'll be stoked to hear that."*

Still stunned, the guard looked behind him, only facing the back of the young woman turn around the corner. Deflated, and defeated, he sighs deeply, and finally walks forward out of the alleyway. 

### (title due)
A weapon raised once more. A briefcase held tightly in the other hand. But this time around, it was Maria herself that was looking down the narrow and short barrel of a pistol. The neutral expression that was on her face while confronting the guard was prominent yet again, as she broke the awkward silence and addressed the person at the end of the barrel, her hands raised. *"Agency, isn't it? What brings you here to me?"*
