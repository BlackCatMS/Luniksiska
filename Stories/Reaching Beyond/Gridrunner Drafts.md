# Gridrunner Drafts
This document is meant to serve as a means of a braindump document regarding Evie's most recent development ideas. In the grand timeline, this connects to [[Routine Maintenance - ARC ver.]] (As it takes place after the fact) and [[TRAVEL RISK]] (As it directly follows up and hints towards the flourishing of Máneá after the Álef Crisis). It also nods to Gradient from Evie's **INTERIM** storyline, who also appears in Travel Risk's [[HEAD TO HEAD - Story]].
## Things to work out
### Evie's Braindump
- **Gridrunners Faction/Organisation**: Because of how United Máneá was originally built on a grid system, this underground and overground organisation of the cities remained. This gives way to undergrounds handymen to perform under-the-radar operations without being seen or without other companies being able to pick up from.
- **"Masked Gang"**: The subways are their turf (Máneán Metro). As a result, **Gridrunners** frequently avoid doing metro routes as much as possible.
- **Palmer-Eden derivative**: Named **SolarDawn** (Stylised as **SOLARdawn**) . This company will be the primary **antagonist** in the story. This company will derive from Palmer-Eden (Who is in a stranglehold on Earth overseen by the Southern States and Canada) in a similar fashion to **Carbine** operating under **Hammerhead** from **2075-2080**. This company existing is the primary reason **Gradient** made her way to Luniks to begin with. (*// This does NOT mean that **Head To Head** can't take place. That takes place in **2075** on Earth. // As of August 2024, this has been worked out within **Head To Head***)
- **Cloning**: Cloning as a concept remains a taboo even in **2090** and onwards. This in turn will connect with **SOLARdawn**. In Cisila's main story, she nearly dies in **PART III**, and is resurrected by Martin. This creates **Gradient**. Next to this, currently drafted is that Martin (Or a figure carrying the torch) will utilise Gradient to create a clone of her. This clone becomes **Cisila** once more as featured in **Routine Maintenance**.
### Connecting the dots
- Logically, and realistically, the story will take place primarily in **Máneá**. A key point is that after the *Kristensend Ball* and *Álef Crisis* in **2075**, Dáritke laid its focus on **Álef** and eventually **Ákros** specifically. This means that the looming threat of a mafia-like agency in the heart of Máneá was now gone, and it was now free of the threat of frequent murders. **Deth-Kelétam** sweeps the floors clean and Máneá embarks an upwards financial curve. 
- **DOCUMENTED** | A key city that will frequently be featured and host the main stories will be **Amadnésam**, **Myddliva**, and **Akhádija**. These cities are located in a triangle spanning about 50km between one another at most, allowing frequent travels between the cities. **Amadnésam** specifically features a city design similar to that in **Mirror's Edge**. That will be the key inspiration to the design of buildings and districts.
- **Gridrunners** are an evolved form of Travel Risk's **Netrunners**. They are capable of doing quite literally anything, including, but not limited to: **Hacking certain groups** (Data breaching, general hacks, etc.), **Disrupting engineering** (Breaking power supplies, vehicles, essential conveyors, etc.) in professional fashion, hampering the targets for long enough, and **Acting as diversions** (If paid enough). **Cisila**, after the events of Routine Maintenance, is a Gridrunner Engineer herself.
### The to-do list
- Several **companies** need to be made from the ground up, which includes names, business directions, and affiliated people. Considering this is taking place in Máneá, extra difficulty comes by making them **native** to Máneá. On another note, **Ódóni Industries** can make a return to **Amadnésam** and take back their previously looted **Neurokick laboratories**. 
	- **Alexandrie Pharmaceuticals**
	- **Jákovy Insurances**
	- **Equinox Medical**
- New **cities** may be necessary to fill up the otherwise empty land of Máneá and its surrounding nations of **Rhódisz** and **Zakh'háfo**. While the latter already has a number of cities at the border, a connection between the two might be limited as Zakh'háfo will **still** be in an economic crisis. This is both induced by the looming threat of Dáritke in Álef and Ákros, as well as a power struggle in the government that is holding back economic recovery and growth. 
	- **Myrdiva**
- **Hammerhead** may see an introduction into Máneá as well, seeking influence, but also offering a baseline for the various means of weaponry and tech used throughout the story. This includes the **Máneán Metro** lines, and may include its various means of weaponry.
	- (*// Are CFI blades Hammerhead-produced?*)
	- **Hammerhead *has* said it will explore options to secure and tighten the metro network in Máneá further from *2075* onwards with the threat of Dáritke having disappeared. Additionally, it has also proposed an overground tram network to the Máneán government to reduce the metro load and security risks from gangs (like Buzzsaws) underground.**
	- **HEART is present in Amadnésam in *2075* in a standoff with SOLARdawn/-Sec.**
- There can be nods to the ongoing research taking place by **Moonlight** and **Carbine**. This could be reflected in chitchat or presented news as a means of filling up the background during the stories. In the same way, a connection back to **Earth** can also be made if **SOLARdawn/PALMER-EDEN** comes into view of the story more frequently.
	- (*// Maria stumbled upon Mika and Gradient in Deth-Kelétam, guiding them towards SOLARdawn in Amadnésam. **Carbine**, and the **Némiskéi institute** are namedropped, which might lead to a ball rolling for either Gradient or Mika in a latter stage.*)
- The **Grid** system that's prominent in Máneá needs to be properly documented. How far does the existing automation stretch out to? Is it limited to rail services, or does it include schedules delivery or even shopkeeping? 
	- (*// Is **Swipe** a fully automated cornerstore?*)

### Events between 2075-2096
Key notes that aren't reflected in any story just yet are:
- **2063**: The **Palmer-Eden Derivative** manages to flee **Illinois** and reaches the gradually recovering industrial triangle of **Amadnésam**, **Myddliva**, and **Akhádija** in the nation of **Máneá**. Under supervision of the Máneán branch of **Hád Bésim**, they pursue their ambitious project of **cloning** a living person, or their remains. 
	- (*-> Mentioned in Head To Head*)
- **Dáritke** leaves behind *Deth-Kelétam*, and **Máneá** as a whole, and now settles in the **Álef** region after **The Agency** collapses in **2075**.
- In **2076**, Maria makes her way to **Shánzhe** to join her old **Carbine** research team under supervision of **Hammerhead**. 
	- (*-> Travel Risk Chapter 17*)
- The **Kósfrii Domes** are installed in **2078**. 
	- (*-> Spider's Web Chapter 5*)
- **Máneá** finally becomes economically stable in **2079**, opening the doors to many new opportunities within its borders after companies slowly make their return now that the nation is deemed to be as safe as it was before the **Zakh'háfon Independence**.
- **Carbine** reopens its doors in **2080**, opening the **Pahlatlán** and **Némiskéi** institutes once more to focus on **space exploration research** using experimental technologies, rather than using them for **weaponry**. 
- **Ódóni Industries** returns to Máneá in **2082**, and opens a factory in **Amadnésam**, sharing duties with the recent startup **SELECT** to resume **Neurokick** production and development and mastering of **Leremkov**. 
	- (*// Connection to PENDULUM?*)
	- (*// Can the evolved version of Neurokicks provide a lead in the Gridrunner development, and even lead to proper documentation of complex cyberattacks?*)
- **Moonlight** parts ways with **Carbine** in **2085**, settling themselves in nearby **Ljívk**. 
- **Starlight** embarks on its ambitious **Dyson Sphere** journey in **2092**, creating and launching a series of experimental satellites around **Choreos** to research the options for creating such a marvel of technology.
- Maria leaves behind the flourishing research team at **Carbine** to focus exclusively on the **ARC** project in **2094**, completing it a mere two years afterwards together with **Thomas Vanhuyt**. Upon completion, she returns to Carbine once more to station herself on the ARC in **2096**. 
	- (*-> [[ARC - Story]]*)
- **Moondial** reaches **Oceana** and subsequently activates the **Oceana-1** space station in **2095**, before landing on the ocean planet and activating research station **Pond-1**. 
- **Late 2096**, after Routine Maintenance, the **Moondial** reaches out to Maria for a first time since it had left left **Carbine**. 
	- (*-> Developed in [[Moonlight Institute]]*)
