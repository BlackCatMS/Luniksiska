Maria's **Golden Bow**, as well as the rest of her future designed ships, would include a health backbone that she called *Alentikíles*, or *Alenti* for short. Raléi's last words continue to cycle through her head every single day, and her call for Maria to live onwards she respected, and evolved as a means through the health backbone in every ship. Even though Raléi wasn't around anymore, her wish would be immortalised as her namesake helped the crew and the ships stay in good shape, no matter what the problem or health issue would be.  
  
**Cintura** was named by Raléi, too. The solar system had been off the radar almost as soon as Lúniks had been discovered, and with a quiet space race suppressing the desire to go even further, space research remained limited to just code names. Whereas Lúniks was 3 lightyears away from Earth, Cintura (then known as Messier-48) was a mere two lightyears away from Lúniks. \
Raléi and Maria, when not in combat, would stargaze together, and after Maria admitting she had a dream of exploring the stars, she coincidentally pointed at the Messier-48 star, daring Raléi to come up with a name for it. Ever since, Cintura was born, and Maria would do anything in her might to immortalise the name.  
  
Raléi truly meant the world to Maria. Wherever possible, she would honour her wishes she had made before her death, and continue her legacy even if it meant stepping out of line or abandoning a passionate project. The **Golden Bow** is even a namesake to Raléi, who had frequently mentioned to love the versatility and shine of gold, and had revealed to have a deep interest in archery, too.  
  
In 2096, having made the promise to never let another life go to waste, she told her own reflection to fight through the worst, no matter how much her mind or body protested against it. While in the Cintura galaxy, and witnessing the wreck of the Silver Pike, it took her a mental breakdown to get back to her senses, and to realign her mind with her goals and promises. Even after Harold would tell her about the loss of life, her mission wouldn't change. Every single person that was still alive, injured or not, would make it back home safe.
