### Communication log between Angelina and Dave, monitored by Unit 4C
*// LOG ENTRY INITIATED. This conversation is now being recorded by request of Unit 4C.* \
**"Yeah, whatever, 4C, it won't change my stance if you record it or not."** Angelina sighed. Before her was a packed folder with not just her own research papers, but a handful of verification papers that she had to go through as well. To her annoyance, she had already decided to pull the trigger on her own sacrifice for this project, and yet, one year after her incredibly tough had been made, she had still not moved a metre forward. *"It's routine, sorry."* The man that was seated next to her said back, a slight hint of annoyance in his own voice as well. *"We'll start at the very top. Dr. Velana, have you read through the terms, agreements, and clauses cited in your papers, and those you have received from SOLARdawn's internal circuit?"* \
**"Twice per day, during lunch and before bedtime. And each and every time I've agreed. Dave, is this really necessary? My stance had remained unchanged since September."** Angelina immediately replied, sighing deeply and crossing her arms as her eyes veered back and forth between the papers, and the Unit that was recording the conversation. *"Let me phrase it differently."* Dave replied, placing the sheet of paper and his pen back on the table before turning his chair around to face Angelina directly. His expression betrayed him, a sense of worry and uncertainty was on full display for her to see. *"Angelina, you understand that if you go through with this, the person known as "Dr. Angelina Velana" will cease to exist, do you? Regardless of whether the projects succeeds or fails, the person that you are right now, the person that I'm having this conversation with, will die."* He continued, taking pauses while speaking to find the correct words, a slight tremble in his voice. \
In response, Angelina glanced away from Dave, and instead took a hold of the stack of papers herself. Taking the pen, she skimmed through the seemingly endless list of verification checks, reading once more through all risks involved, the procedure that would take place, and the ultimate fate that she would face. And yet, she flew through the papers. Angelina knew exactly what not just Dave, but the rest of SOLARdawn was worried about, and even so, she scribbled her signature at the very bottom of each page, dropping the pen loudly on top of the table and resuming the stare into Dave's eyes. **"Do you understand, Dave?"** She asked, her brows furrowing. \
*"I.. believe I do."* He sighed back, his elbow resting on the table and his hand now pressing against his forehead. *"But, Angelina, even if you agree, I don't think Polaris would-"* \
**"Polaris has not once agreed with me, Dave, every paper that has the name "Velana" stamped on it is rejected!"** Angelina scoffed, almost snapping completely upon the mere mention of the name "Polaris". Holding her hand flat on the table, she did her best to hold back from lashing out any further, but taking a deep breath, she slowly continued. **"This project is separate from Polaris's wishes altogether. I could not care less what he has to say about it, it doesn't involve him in the slightest."** \
Dave was left shocked, and even if he would bring up what was on his mind, he knew that it would not help Angelina's case any further. As much as he hated to admit it, he wasn't able to convince her in the slightest about changing her stance, changing anything regarding the project she had been working on for over a year now. She was at the doorstep of starting Project Angel, something she had been dreaming of working towards, something she had envisioned from the very moment she walked through the doors in Amadnésam almost a decade ago. \
*"I get it, forget that I mentioned Polaris altogether."* He said back in defeat, and taking a folder from the far end of the table, he handed it to Angelina. *"This is from a few decades ago, back when PALMER-EDEN was still in service in America. 4C has analysed it and figured out that there have been no reported cases where Ultima and Leremkov have been mixed. It thinks it might hamper the project."* He continued, a worried smile appearing on his face while Angelina's eyes darted towards the small, orange box that was on top of the table on their opposing end. In its centre, it had a camera lens that was continuously recording the conversation between the two researches, but 4C was capable of much, much more when connected to its main terminal in the research halls. But raising her eyebrow, Angelina didn't think too much of the robot's ideas about her project. **"Have the old man Vitaly come to my office as soon as possible. I know he's in Amadnésam right now, and if this is really the last weak link, I can have it fixed and start immediately."** She said, her eyes darting from the spinning camera lens towards Dave's eyes. But in a matter of seconds, she bundles up all her papers and left the signed checklist on the table, standing up from her chair and promptly leaving the room. With a deep sigh, Dave could only watch her leave and close the door shut tight behind her, and glancing to his right, he skimmed through the papers that Angelina had left behind. Each and every checkbox was marked on "Agree", only cementing her fate as the vessel for the project. Shaking his head, he stared at the papers in disbelief for a few moments, before glancing at the orange box, the worried smile remaining on his face. *"4C, stop the recording."* \
*// LOG ENTRY ENDED. The recording has been saved. Connect me to a terminal to view it.*

### Addendum
**Project Angel**, as designed by the namesake **Angelina Velana** herself, is a project that attempts to unlock humanity's full potential, combining the supernaturalism of the once prestigious **Ultima** project that dated back to **PALMER-EDEN**, and the ever developing possibilities that open up by **Vitaly Leremkov**'s ongoing research with mixing human DNA with animal DNA to reduce any human flaws. \
Even with all risks assessed, it would still be an enormous challenge to have everything go smoothly during a single operation. As nobody was willing enough to become the vessel for the project, Angelina herself made the decision after searching and waiting for half a year, eventually stepping forward to become the recipient of a **Flame Heart**. (*// This is what allows Angel to ignite her spear at free will in [[KILLJOY - Story]], the shaft of the spear is a channel that prevents the spear itself from igniting and burning, channelling her ability to the tip alone.*) \
The operation alone is where things become more awry. The replacement of a heart, and the subsequent stress on the recipient's body from the further changes induced by Leremkov, tied together with being under anaesthetics for almost a day straight leaves them with a high risk of amnesia following the operation. This is what Dave implied with *"The person I'm having this conversation with will die"*, as the person that is Angelina will no longer exist following the operation. Under guidance of 4C, she is set to undergo rehabilitation and in the following months, learn to master her abilities and newfound strength, whoever that "Angel" might become.
