# Reaching Beyond
From the **1970**s until the early **2000**s, almost every nation on earth had come together to combine their strengths and forces to achieve the ultimate feat for humanity: Settle another planet, and settle space. In **2005**, this unanimous dream had become a reality, and the rest of the newly-settled planet of Lúniks became history.

From the **2080**s onwards, a similar dream had awakened within the crumbling industry of **Carbine**, a company that primarily focuses on experimental technologies, including weaponry, but also spaceship technology and satellite construction, with its eyes set for far beyond their current solar system. After a nuclear incident occurred in **Kósfrii**, in **2073**, with its main cause being faulty experimental weapon technology, Carbine pulled back from any sort of technology advancements for the rest of the decade. But the teams in **Némiskéi** remained itchy, eager to get back to work, eager to achieve the impossible in another way. And from that desire, the **Carbine Research Institute** was founded with one common goal: Reignite the flame of space exploration that was lost in **2005**.

## Stories
### ARC
Available at [[ARC - Story]]. The **ARC**, **Advanced Research for Carbine**, is an enormous space station in orbit of Lúniks, which serves as a control hub for space traffic for outbound research being conducted on other planets and moons, but also serves as a research station for research regarding experimental practices. The story of the **ARC** follows **Maria Limáida** and **Thomas Vanhuyt** in their design process, the hunt for funding, up until the eventual inauguration of the ARC not even two years after the project began.
