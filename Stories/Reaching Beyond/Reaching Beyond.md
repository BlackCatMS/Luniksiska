# Reaching Beyond
From the **1970**s until the early **2000**s, almost every nation on earth had come together to combine their strengths and forces to achieve the ultimate feat for humanity: Settle another planet, and settle space. In **2005**, this unanimous dream had become a reality, and the rest of the newly-settled planet of Lúniks became history.

From the **2080**s onwards, a similar dream had awakened within the crumbling industry of **Carbine**, a company that primarily focuses on experimental technologies, including weaponry, but also spaceship technology and satellite construction, with its eyes set for far beyond their current solar system. After a nuclear incident occurred in **Kósfrii**, in **2073**, with its main cause being faulty experimental weapon technology, Carbine pulled back from any sort of technology advancements for the rest of the decade. But the teams in **Némiskéi** remained itchy, eager to get back to work, eager to achieve the impossible in another way. And from that desire, the **Carbine Research Institute** was founded with one common goal: Reignite the flame of space exploration that was lost in **2005**.

## Folder Organisation
### Addendum / Drafts
Available at [[Addendum - Drafts]]. \
During the development and writing of **Routine Maintenance, ARC ver.**, a lot of sudden thoughts come to mind, and a lot of lore is dropped without a proper documentation. This page will act as a sieve to filter out the used drafts, and act as a board of what terms might need further explanation in another document later on.

### List of Spaceships
Available at [[List of Spaceships]]. \
Both **Hammerhead** and **Carbine** have seen an increase in the exploration of space since the **2080**s, which comes with the creation of many generations and types of spaceships, as well as space stations. This evolving document will list all of the mentioned, or drafted ships, and explain a little bit of their history.

## Stories
### ARC
Available at [[ARC - Story]]. The **ARC**, **Advanced Research for Carbine**, is an enormous space station in orbit of Lúniks, which serves as a control hub for space traffic for outbound research being conducted on other planets and moons, but also serves as a research station for research regarding experimental practices. The story of the **ARC** follows **Maria Limáida** and **Thomas Vanhuyt** in their design process, the hunt for funding, up until the eventual inauguration of the ARC not even two years after the project began.
