# Routine Maintenance - ARC ver.
Directly parallels "ROUTINE MAINTENANCE" by Evie, which is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/eviedense/CI.SI/blob/main/EXTRA/LUNIKS%20COORDINATION/ROUTINE%20MAINTENANCE.md). \
While Routine Maintenance focuses exclusively on the **Alessi Shuttle** ships, the **Platinum Halberd** and **Silver Pike**, the **ARC ver.** of the same story will focus on the developments that take place on the ARC as the two ships vanish off the radar and detection systems. 
## Synopsis
The **Silver Pike** and **Platinum Halberd** (Codenamed **Alessi Shuttles**), sharing a blueprint and having been launched in **2092** and **2093**, respectively, are most known for their research and projects that they have conducted in the **Alessi Belt**. Both of these ships have been equipped with top-of-the-line equipment that is deemed vital for the research they're conducting, and answering the decade-old question of: *"Is it viable for humanity to utilise the nearest gas planet to terraform the nearest rock planet?"* This question is both present in the Solar and Choreos systems, where Mars and Dvóniks are both hot topics of the next era in humanity's journey for settling the stars, but with their cold, barren nature, it would almost seem impossible to create a long-lasting settlement on either of these planets.

The **Alessi Shuttles** swing between Dvóniks and Lóivonus over the span of 90 days, researching and harvesting energy from Lóivonus and bringing it towards Dvóniks to determine in what ways said energy could be utilised. After completing their loop, they temporarily return to Lúniks by either docking to the **ARC** or landing in **Némiskéi** to submit their data, switch crews if needed, and to restock on necessities, before they would continue on another loop between the two planets. 

In **2096**, not too long after the **ARC** had been activated, the **Silver Pike** vanished off the radars in **June** after having spent three days in orbit of Lóivonus. Keeping their composure and embarking on the hunt to figure out what had happened to the first **Alessi** ship, the **Platinum Halberd** would not receive any information regarding the fate of the **Silver Pike** after docking at the **ARC** in late July. Everyone in Carbine worked overtime to figure out what was going on with the strange disappearance of the ship, but an unbeknownst Halberd would continue onto their 4th loop towards Lóivonus, where it would meet the same fate as the Pike, and disappear off the radars.

## 1 - Closing the loop
*// The **Silver Pike** docks with the **ARC** for the third time, completing their third loop through the **Alessi Belt**. Their findings are sent towards Némiskéi, the stocks are refilled, and the crew embarks on their next journey.*

## 2 - Light's out
*// The **Silver Pike** reports a strange incident near the engines, and after an investigation after their third day in orbit of Lóivonus, they suddenly vanish off the radars without a single trace.*

## 3 - Light's out II 
*// The **Platinum Halberd** docks with the **ARC** while investigation regarding the disappearance of the **Silver Pike** is still undergoing. None of the teams inform the crew of the Halberd, which undocks and departs for the fateful destination of Lóivonus two days afterwards. Reaching the gas planet about ten days after, the ARC loses their signal too, adding another question mark to the already mysterious situation.*
