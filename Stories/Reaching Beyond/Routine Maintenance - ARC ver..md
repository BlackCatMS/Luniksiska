# Routine Maintenance - ARC ver.
Directly parallels "ROUTINE MAINTENANCE" by Evie, which is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/eviedense/CI.SI/blob/main/EXTRA/LUNIKS%20COORDINATION/ROUTINE%20MAINTENANCE.md). \
While Routine Maintenance focuses exclusively on the **Alessi Shuttle** ships, the **Platinum Halberd** and **Silver Pike**, the **ARC ver.** of the same story will focus on the developments that take place on the ARC as the two ships vanish off the radar and detection systems. 
## Synopsis
The **Silver Pike** and **Platinum Halberd** (Codenamed **Alessi Shuttles**), sharing a blueprint and having been launched in **2092** and **2093**, respectively, are most known for their research and projects that they have conducted in the **Alessi Belt**. Both of these ships have been equipped with top-of-the-line equipment that is deemed vital for the research they're conducting, and answering the decade-old question of: *"Is it viable for humanity to utilise the nearest gas planet to terraform the nearest rock planet?"* This question is both present in the Solar and Choreos systems, where Mars and Dvóniks are both hot topics of the next era in humanity's journey for settling the stars, but with their cold, barren nature, it would almost seem impossible to create a long-lasting settlement on either of these planets.

The **Alessi Shuttles** swing between Dvóniks and Lóivonus over the span of 90 days, researching and harvesting energy from Lóivonus and bringing it towards Dvóniks to determine in what ways said energy could be utilised. After completing their loop, they temporarily return to Lúniks by either docking to the **ARC** or landing in **Némiskéi** to submit their data, switch crews if needed, and to restock on necessities, before they would continue on another loop between the two planets. 

In **2096**, not too long after the **ARC** had been activated, the **Silver Pike** vanished off the radars in **June** after having spent three days in orbit of Lóivonus. Keeping their composure and embarking on the hunt to figure out what had happened to the first **Alessi** ship, the **Platinum Halberd** would not receive any information regarding the fate of the **Silver Pike** after docking at the **ARC** in late July. Everyone in Carbine worked overtime to figure out what was going on with the strange disappearance of the ship, but an unbeknownst Halberd would continue onto their 4th loop towards Lóivonus, where it would meet the same fate as the Pike, and disappear off the radars.

## 1 - Closing the loop
*// The **Silver Pike** docks with the **ARC** for the third time, completing their third loop through the **Alessi Belt**. Their findings are sent towards Némiskéi, the stocks are refilled, and the crew embarks on their next journey.*

**"327. Cleared to dock. You may connect to Terminal E. Silver Pike, welcome home."** A gentle voice spoke into the microphone before him. A quiet static found its way through the emptiness of the space that separated the inbound ship and the headphones of the signaller, before a voice became clear through the static. *"Silver Pike, 327. Affirmative. Docking at Terminal E."* \
A little under a minute afterwards, a quiet and feint *thunk* pressed against the northern bridge of the enormous space station that set Carbine's new image in stone. The **Silver Pike** had just returned from its third iteration of the mission it had been assigned soon after it was launched into space for a first time. It was destined to shuttle through the **Alessi Belt**, travelling to Lóivonus to harvest energy and monitor the existing satellites that were orbiting the gas planet, and then using its gravitational swing to launch itself towards the barren planet of Dvóniks. It would orbit the empty planet for a few days, utilising the energy harvested from Lóivonus to make magic work, and try different ways to make Dvóniks a suitable planet for the next settlement project for humanity.

Before long, most of the crew aboard had made its way onto the ARC, where they would spend the rest of the day to take it easy now that their third mission was complete. The ARC was lively, and frequent shuttles would carry the goods that would eventually make their way onto ships like the Silver Pike to ready them before embarking on their next mission, all while intensive research takes place on the ARC itself as well. 

The control room of the ARC, the **Bridge**, was where all the magic happened. All hands were on deck, and much like the name suggests, everything was well under their control, maintaining all the systems present on the ARC, but also serving as a beacon for the various spaceships that were present in the Choreos system. Even the **150**, the **Jade Dagger**, still kept in touch frequently all the way from the 7th planet, **Márivonus**. But spaceship contact aside, the Bridge also had its eyes on all of the research taking place, keeping an almost never-ending log of changes and notes that were submitted from the various hubs spread throughout the wings of the ARC. But the one person to lead them all, was no other than the designer of the space station herself, **Maria Limáida**.

**"Been a while, Maria!"** The captain of the Silver Pike cheerfully said as he walked through the doors of the Bridge, waving at Maria's back, who seemed to be zoned out gazing at the stars. In his hand, he carried a heavy box that stored all the data they had acquired over the past three months during their swing through the Alessi Belt, and holding his other hand out he shook hands with the woman he had called out. **"It's becoming a routine.. Dvóniks doesn't seem to take too much interest in us."** He sighed deeply, Maria's neutral expression remaining unchanged. With the box placed on the board behind them, the rest of the crew on the Bridge takes care of it and begins to extract the data while Maria escorts the captain towards the nearby café in the eastern wing to catch up.

*// Elaborating into: Chitchat with Maria and introduction to the yet-unnamed caption of the Silver Pike. They exchange findings and before long, the ship already completes its routine and heads off towards Lóivonus for a next time.*

## 2 - Light's out
*// The **Silver Pike** reports a strange incident near the engines, and after an investigation during their third day in orbit of Lóivonus, they suddenly vanish off the radars without a single trace.*

*// Edited/cont.: The **Silver Pike**, as they investigate the odd damage and malfunctioning of their starboard engines, is frequently in touch with the ARC. Whilst staying in orbit for an emergency fourth day, the signal is suddenly interrupted and broken as a stray asteroid from Lóivonus's ring forced it way against and through the Silver Pike's B-deck hallway, immediately demolishing anything that it found in its path and causing the Loop engine to engage, leading the fateful ship away from Lóivonus, into deep space.*

## 3 - Light's out II 
*// The **Platinum Halberd** docks with the **ARC** while investigation regarding the disappearance of the **Silver Pike** is still undergoing. None of the teams inform the crew of the Halberd, which undocks and departs for the fateful destination of Lóivonus two days afterwards. Reaching the gas planet about ten days after, the ARC loses their signal too, adding another question mark to the already mysterious situation.*
