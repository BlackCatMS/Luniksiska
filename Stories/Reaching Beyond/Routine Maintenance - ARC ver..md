# Routine Maintenance - ARC ver.
Directly parallels "ROUTINE MAINTENANCE" by Evie, which is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/eviedense/CI.SI/blob/main/EXTRA/LUNIKS%20COORDINATION/ROUTINE%20MAINTENANCE.md). \
While Routine Maintenance focuses exclusively on the **Alessi Shuttle** ships, the **Platinum Halberd** and **Silver Pike**, the **ARC ver.** of the same story will focus on the developments that take place on the ARC as the two ships vanish off the radar and detection systems. 
## Synopsis
The **Silver Pike** and **Platinum Halberd** (Codenamed **Alessi Shuttles**), sharing a blueprint and having been launched in **2092** and **2093**, respectively, are most known for their research and projects that they have conducted in the **Alessi Belt**. Both of these ships have been equipped with top-of-the-line equipment that is deemed vital for the research they're conducting, and answering the decade-old question of: *"Is it viable for humanity to utilise the nearest gas planet to terraform the nearest rock planet?"* This question is both present in the Solar and Choreos systems, where Mars and Dvóniks are both hot topics of the next era in humanity's journey for settling the stars, but with their cold, barren nature, it would almost seem impossible to create a long-lasting settlement on either of these planets.

The **Alessi Shuttles** swing between Dvóniks and Lóivonus over the span of 90 days, researching and harvesting energy from Lóivonus and bringing it towards Dvóniks to determine in what ways said energy could be utilised. After completing their loop, they temporarily return to Lúniks by either docking to the **ARC** or landing in **Némiskéi** to submit their data, switch crews if needed, and to restock on necessities, before they would continue on another loop between the two planets. 

In **2096**, not too long after the **ARC** had been activated, the **Silver Pike** vanished off the radars in **June** after having spent three days in orbit of Lóivonus. Keeping their composure and embarking on the hunt to figure out what had happened to the first **Alessi** ship, the **Platinum Halberd** would not receive any information regarding the fate of the **Silver Pike** after docking at the **ARC** in late July. Everyone in Carbine worked overtime to figure out what was going on with the strange disappearance of the ship, but an unbeknownst Halberd would continue onto their 4th loop towards Lóivonus, where it would meet the same fate as the Pike, and disappear off the radars.

## 1 - Closing the loop
*// The **Silver Pike** docks with the **ARC** for the third time, completing their third loop through the **Alessi Belt**. Their findings are sent towards Némiskéi, the stocks are refilled, and the crew embarks on their next journey.*

**"327. Cleared to dock. You may connect to Terminal E. Silver Pike, welcome home."** A gentle voice spoke into the microphone before him. A quiet static found its way through the emptiness of the space that separated the inbound ship and the headphones of the signaller, before a voice became clear through the static. *"Silver Pike, 327. Affirmative. Docking at Terminal E."* \
A little under a minute afterwards, a quiet and feint *thunk* pressed against the northern bridge of the enormous space station that set Carbine's new image in stone. The **Silver Pike** had just returned from its third iteration of the mission it had been assigned soon after it was launched into space for a first time. It was destined to shuttle through the **Alessi Belt**, travelling to Lóivonus to harvest energy and monitor the existing satellites that were orbiting the gas planet, and then using its gravitational swing to launch itself towards the barren planet of Dvóniks. It would orbit the empty planet for a few days, utilising the energy harvested from Lóivonus to make magic work, and try different ways to make Dvóniks a suitable planet for the next settlement project for humanity.

Before long, most of the crew aboard had made its way onto the ARC, where they would spend the rest of the day to take it easy now that their third mission was complete. The ARC was lively, and frequent shuttles would carry the goods that would eventually make their way onto ships like the Silver Pike to ready them before embarking on their next mission, all while intensive research takes place on the ARC itself as well. 

The control room of the ARC, the **Bridge**, was where all the magic happened. All hands were on deck, and much like the name suggests, everything was well under their control, maintaining all the systems present on the ARC, but also serving as a beacon for the various spaceships that were present in the Choreos system. Even the **150**, the **Jade Dagger**, still kept in touch frequently all the way from the 7th planet, **Márivonus**. But spaceship contact aside, the Bridge also had its eyes on all of the research taking place, keeping an almost never-ending log of changes and notes that were submitted from the various hubs spread throughout the wings of the ARC. But the one person to lead them all, was no other than the designer of the space station herself, **Maria Limáida**.

**"Been a while, Maria!"** The captain of the Silver Pike cheerfully said as he walked through the doors of the Bridge, waving at Maria's back, who seemed to be zoned out gazing at the stars. In his hand, he carried a heavy box that stored all the data they had acquired over the past three months during their swing through the Alessi Belt, and holding his other hand out he shook hands with the woman he had called out. **"It's becoming a routine.. Dvóniks doesn't seem to take too much interest in us."** He sighed deeply, Maria's neutral expression remaining unchanged. With the box placed on the board behind them, the rest of the crew on the Bridge takes care of it and begins to extract the data while Maria escorts the captain towards the nearby café in the eastern wing to catch up.

*// Elaborating into: Chitchat with Maria and introduction to the yet-unnamed caption of the Silver Pike. They exchange findings and before long, the ship already completes its routine and heads off towards Lóivonus for a next time.*

## 2 - Light's out
*// The **Silver Pike** reports a strange incident near the engines, and after an investigation during their third day in orbit of Lóivonus, they suddenly vanish off the radars without a single trace.*

*// Edited/cont.: The **Silver Pike**, as they investigate the odd damage and malfunctioning of their starboard engines, is frequently in touch with the ARC. Whilst staying in orbit for an emergency fourth day, the signal is suddenly interrupted and broken as a stray asteroid from Lóivonus's ring forced it way against and through the Silver Pike's B-deck hallway, immediately demolishing anything that it found in its path and causing the Loop engine to engage, leading the fateful ship away from Lóivonus, into deep space.*

**"327, report to Control, please. Requesting a status update on your aforementioned engine mishaps."** \
A quiet static followed, after which the response of the caption of the **Silver Pike** reached the **ARC**. *"Engines one through four, unchanged. Felipe is doing physical checks now. We believe it's asteroid debris."* Was Captain Solen's reply. Having been in charge since the launch of the Pike, his experience that he acquired on other ships allowed him to keep his cool in dire situations like these. Another static came through, followed by Solen's voice once more. *"327 is taking a fourth day in orbit. Swing postponed until further notice. We'll keep you posted on our engines."* \
The comms were cut, a static was followed by a silence, only to be broken by the deep sigh of Thomas, who was overseeing the communication between the Pike and the ARC. He shook his head, and promptly turned around towards the exit of the bridge. 

*"Head down, hopeless expression?"* A voice smirked at the top of the stairwell that Thomas was walking towards, as he turns his head back up in surprise. *"I don't think I've ever seen you lose hope this quickly, Thomas. Especially not on the embodiment of our blood, sweat, and tears right here."* \
Thomas recognised the voice without a single doubt, it belonged to Maria. **"Maria.."** He began, sighing deeply once more. **"It's.. you know the exact ins and outs of the engines I developed for the Alessi Shuttle blueprints, do you not?"** \
Maria's expression turned from a frown to a more confused look, not understanding what her long-term colleague was trying to get at. Thomas stood still in his tracks, crossing his arms, and his head looked at the bright, white floor panels below him as he continued. **"All four engines can't disable at once. In the worst case, it would cycle through each engine to determine which engine failed, place that engine in hibernation while the crew works on a fix, and if no fix can be made, the mission is aborted and the ship returns to Némiskéi under reduced power."** \
Maria's eyes opened wide, her ears perking up in surprise and in disbelief. *"That means.-"* \
Thomas interrupted her, his eyes now looking directly into those of Maria. **"This isn't my doing. Something is interfering with the engines, that is out of our control."** \
Without a second thought, Maria ran towards the control deck at the windows of the bridge, reaching for nearest commander's headset, immediately redirecting the signal to the **327**. She felt in her guts that something terrible was about to happen, and despite not having any facts to back it up, the fact that Thomas's concerns about the engines were out of his doing, he himself believed that after their fourth day in orbit, the crew would realise the engines wouldn't return and the ship would be tugged back to Lúniks with help from the **Platinum Halberd**, or jump closer towards its home. But Maria knew that Thomas was lenient with situations like these, and she herself couldn't deal with such a high risk floating around while powerless. With the headset put on, she clenched her fist as the static echoed through her head. The mixture of radio silence made her feel she was too late, but in a matter of seconds, the static ended and the familiar voice of Captain Solen returned. **"327, reporting in. Status unchanged."** \
Maria took a deep breath, doing her best to keep her mind at ease, as she began to explain the situation to the captain of the powerless Pike. *"It's Maria. Thomas just explained to me that all four engines can't fail at once, and it will try to cycle through each engine time and time again to provide power and thrust at any cost. Have you had any power surges and losses since entering orbit?"* \
The Pike remained silent momentarily, only the flipping through pages and clicking of buttons could be heard, but after a moment, Solen replied. **"It's, mostly been flatlined since entering orbit. Felipe mentioned asteroid debris in Engine two, it seems it may have damaged the fuel system altogether, but he's back on board now so I'll ask him shortly."** \
Maria sighed deeply, understanding Solen's explanation and lack of panic, but the feeling in her gut refused to dissipate. *"Solen, the ARC commands. Enable the Loop engine and return to Lumen."* She began, her voice shaking as she looked at the emptiness of the space before her through the windows of the bridge. Lúniks's moon could be seen in the corner of her left eye, the faint glow of the moon base acting as a beacon for other spaceships. *"The risk is too great..- I don't want you taking it.* \
The clicking of buttons could be heard, followed by a distant, static buzzing. **"Copy, Maria. 327 engaged Loop engine. Course set to Lu-"** 

The signal was cut short, and before an infinite amount of static, a loud and violent bang could be heard. Maria froze in place as the sound of scraping and collapsing metal echoed through her head, followed by various alarms going off in the bridge of the Pike. The buzzing noise of the Loop engine engaging remained active, and seemed to only go up in pitch and volume. With her hand pressing against the right earcup of the headset, the buzzing cut out spontaneously and the contact between the ARC and the Silver Pike was broken. 

Maria took off the headset, and her eyes kept focusing on a feint star in the far distance, all while the rest of the staff at the bridge triggered their own alarms and began to scramble for answers on why the Silver Pike had just vanished off the radars. The doors of the bridge behind her closed, Thomas had taken his leave from the bridge, and Maria continued to stare deeply at the same star for minutes on end. Her heart was pounding in her chest, and she whispered to herself the name of the star.

*"Cintura"*

### Addendum
The **Loop engine** activated, but had changed courses as Thomas's designed failsafe activated. Both the ships were equipped with the first generation Loop engines, which would work in a more efficient manner than the previous engines that he decided, and would last much further into the future without needing frequent maintenance. The course was originally set to **Lumen**, Lúniks's moon, but the failsafe caused the ship to jump to **Cintura**, the poorly-explored solar system that is three lightyears away from Lúniks. Thomas discovered that it was astronomically quiet there, which meant it would be a safe haven for ships in distress to depart towards in case of a fatal accident, in which they can stay there while help is on its way.

Only Maria and Thomas are aware of this, because the project was not supposed to be activated yet. Once the Loop engine activated, but no ship appeared near Lumen, Maria immediately know where the ship had instead sent itself towards after getting fatally hit by the asteroid. With Thomas taking his leave to return to the drawing board in shock, Maria decides to keep this information for herself for the time being, the gut feeling having changed from hopelessness for the survivors of the Pike, into confidence that the self-sufficient systems would keep the ship running before she could send the **Golden Bow** to rescue it. However, this meant that the **Platinum Halberd**, the Pike's sister ship, would not receive the information about the asteroid activity near Lóivonus, and embark on her next mission unbeknownst to what they would face there.


## 3 - Light's out II 
*// The **Platinum Halberd** docks with the **ARC** while investigation regarding the disappearance of the **Silver Pike** is still undergoing. None of the teams inform the crew of the Halberd, which undocks and departs for the fateful destination of Lóivonus two days afterwards. Reaching the gas planet about ten days after, the ARC loses their signal too, adding another question mark to the already mysterious situation.*

*// Edited/con.: Before the **Silver Pike**'s fateful collision with an asteroid in Lóivonus, the **Platinum Halberd** connects to the **ARC**. This gives a brief introduction to the crew and cast of the Halberd, giving it a tighter connection with the **Halberd ver.** of the story. After their planned docking for two days, the ship departs once more and follows the route of the Pike, which vanished off the radars a day after the Halberd had departed. While the **ARC** investigates the mysterious disappearance, the Halberd remains unknowing about the fate of the Pike, and soon enough, a strange asteroid similar to the one that struck the Pike, is found in one of her starboard engines, ultimately causing the Loop engine to activate as an emergency, sending the ship off the radars as well and leading it towards the remnants of the Pike.*

## Addendum
Notes to consider (Although unrelated to Routine Maintenance specifically):
- Various satellites in orbit of planets or complimenting spaceships follow a **Fruit** naming scheme. As an example, **150**, the **Jade Dagger**, constructs and deploys satellites used for research of the planet **Márivonus** on-site, which follow the codename **Mango-(1-4)**.
- The reason the **Silver Pike** and **Platinum Halberd** both found themselves in the same spot after their Loop engine to engage as an experimental failsafe in case of emergencies. This was a development made by Thomas, who saw the increased risk of experimental spaceships becoming remnants of their past and floating around endlessly in deep space without knowing what was going on after the **Failed Hammerhead Satellite Ship** begun floating freely through space. The Loop engine would send them to a fixed point in space, where another ship could aid them once a distress signal would go through to the **ARC**.
