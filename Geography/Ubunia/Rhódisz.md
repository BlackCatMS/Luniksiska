# Rhódisz
Nestled between [[Máneá]] and [[Zakh'háfo]], Rhódisz managed to make its way out of the economic crisis that emerged within the three nations the quickest, and quickly became the safe haven for all sort of scientific development that was riddled with corruption in the other nations. In hopes to further strengthen itself, it grew a tight bond with **Thórirsant** and **Léjtis**.
