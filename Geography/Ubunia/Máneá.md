Known natively as **Unifísai Ertbitsai da Máneá**. \

Together with [[Zakh'háfo]] and [[Rhódisz]], Máneá was originally part of a much larger nation, encompassing the entire area below **Thórirsant**, before an economic crisis inevitably split the nation into two, before **Rhódisz** also split off of what remained of Máneá. 

Despite making good progress on working its way out of the economic crisis that left the nation in despair, it remains a relic of what greatness it once possessed, and because of the deregulated government, many cities find themselves riddled with drug dealing masterclass.

## Fsát-Hokh (Capital)
Together with Zakh'háfo, Máneá entered a similar economic recession quickly after gaining independence. However, due to the uprising in civil unrest soon after the forcefully created government tried to limit the everyday life of its citizens in hopes to restore the collapsing economy, the capital soon collapsed under its own weight. 

## Deth-Kelétam
Frequently dubbed as the "Capital of drugs", Deth-Kelétam served home soon after the collapse of Máneá, and its deteriorated automated transport system still chugs along to this day, giving way to every sort of illegal trade in broad daylight. 

## Amadnésam
Before the collapse of **United Máneá**, Amadnésam was considered to be the research capital of Máneá, a title it retained after the collapse for another few years, but inevitably lost after the economy plummeted not too long after. The city had been divided into several zone, which included various residential zones, an economic district, and research/science districts, all connected through a tightly woven metro network.
