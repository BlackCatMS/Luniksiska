## Fsát-Hokh (Capital)
Together with Zakh'háfo, Máneá entered a similar economic recession quickly after gaining independence. However, due to the uprising in civil unrest soon after the forcefully created government tried to limit the everyday life of its citizens in hopes to restore the collapsing economy, the capital soon collapsed under its own weight. 

## Deth-Kelétam
Frequently dubbed as the "Capital of drugs", Deth-Kelétam served home soon after the collapse of Máneá, and its deteriorated automated transport system still chugs along to this day, giving way to every sort of illegal trade in broad daylight. 

## Amadnésam
Before the collapse of **United Máneá**, Amadnésam was considered to be the research capital of Máneá, a title it retained after the collapse for another few years, until the economic collapse of the entire country. The city had been divided into several zone, which included various residential zones, an economic district, and research/science districts, all connected through a tightly woven metro network.
