## Ákros (Capital)
After a sudden split from United Máneá, Ákros was left in a fallen, newly formed country, already facing a deep recession right from the start. Nonetheless, Ákros serves home to the new financial district of Zakh'háfo, which is set to be the centre of economic growth for the future of not only Ákros and its surrounding villages, but to bloom Zakh'háfo as a whole.
