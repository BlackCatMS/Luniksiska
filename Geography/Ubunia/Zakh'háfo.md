Natively known as **Zakh'háfónai Ertbitsai**. \

Together with [[Máneá]] and [[Rhódisz]], Máneá was originally part of a much larger nation, encompassing the entire area below **Thórirsant**, before an economic crisis inevitably split the country into two, and all three nations plummeted into a situation that could only be described as "despair". 

Zakh'háfo took the worst hit out of the three nations, and still remains in that state of despair as of now. Because of the severely deregulated government, the only things that remained the same were the automated metro and train connections connecting the various cities and districts within them, which paved the way for easy high-traffic drug dealing. 

## Ákros (Capital)
After a sudden split from United Máneá, Ákros was left in a fallen, newly formed country, already facing a deep recession right from the start. Nonetheless, Ákros serves home to the new financial district of Zakh'háfo, which is set to be the centre of economic growth for the future of not only Ákros and its surrounding villages, but to bloom Zakh'háfo as a whole.
