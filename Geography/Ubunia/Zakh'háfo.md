*// This section needs to be updated, as it's out of date.* Together with [[Máneá]] and [[Rhódisz]], **Zakh'háfo** was originally part of a much larger nation, encompassing the entire area below **Thórirsant**, before an economic crisis inevitably split the nation into two, and all three nations plummeted into a situation that could only be described as "despair". 

Despite having rallied for independence for many years, Zakh'háfo took the worst hit out of the three nations after it finally gained its independence in **2039**, and still remains in that state of despair as of now (**2075**). Because of the severely deregulated government, the only things that remained the same were the automated metro and train connections connecting the various cities and districts within them, which paved the way for easy high-traffic drug dealing. 
## Ákros (Capital)
After a sudden split from United Máneá, Ákros was left in a fallen, newly formed nation, already facing a deep recession right from the start. Nonetheless, Ákros serves home to the new financial district of Zakh'háfo, which is set to be the centre of economic growth for the future of not only Ákros and its surrounding villages, but to bloom Zakh'háfo as a whole.
