# Léjtis
Known natively as the **Free State of Léjtis**. Léjtis is placed on the island under **Máneá** and **Zakh'háfo**. This is reflected on the 2020 map sketch.

Similarly to the island off the east coast of Vestia, Léjtis remained uninhabited for a good while before a group of settlers made their way towards the island, settling the port of Pórtvéj, which quickly became the biggest city on the island and its capital.
## Pórtvéj (Capital)
What once started as a simple settlement on the island, quickly became a thriving harbour for anything the island and bay could offer. Within a few years, the town of Pórtvéj grew out to encompass almost a third of the island, becoming a hub for fishery, naval transport, and everything inbetween.
