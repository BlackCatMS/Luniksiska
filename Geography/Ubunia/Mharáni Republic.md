# Mharáni Republic
The Mharáni Republic is a decently-sized country off the east coast of Ubunia, bordering Kérisant and sharing most of its landscape with the **Mharáni Desert** to the south. Originally requested in **2003**, Kápan Bëndén had been keeping his eyes in the Mharáni desert since **2001**, and discovered what he believed to be an infinite goldmine, a literal one at that. Because of this, he made the request to the ESA to have land from drawn Kérisant allocated to him, to create the Mharáni Republic. It's capital city remains Nazár, but the immense gold mines are present deep in the deserts in the city of Aurum.
