# Íszkéde
Íszkéde is located far in the east of Ellitroomi, connecting to the *yet unnamed eastern Ellitroomi sea*. Because of its poor location and connections to other nations, it hasn't had the same growth spurt that the other nations, which are located on the west of Ubunia and east of Vestia, had experienced in their first years on the planet.
