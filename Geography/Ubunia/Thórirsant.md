# Thórirsant
Settled by [[List of notable people#Jonathán Þórirson]], the nation of Thórirsant was the first nation to set its borders, which had quickly after gone through many changed with the births of various other nations. It's flag is identical to the flag that is usually passed on as the "Flag of Luniks", a horizontal three-coloured white-green-black flag. \

## Nóve Réjkjavik (Capital)
Named after the city of birth of Jonathán Þórirsson, founder and first settler of the planet of Lúniks. Initially, it was often referred to as "Capital of the planet", though this quickly disappeared again once *Vestia* started to get gradually settled. \
The city is best known for its "dart board" approach to city district planning. It's divided into a circle with eight slices, each of which have three layers, going from main district (city center) and residential areas -> park area and roads -> district centers and residential areas. This type of layering was suggested by Xárif Álufxent, a close friend of þórirsson who studied architecture and expertise in urban planning. Together with a team that was formed at the university he studied at, the foundations and blueprints for Nóve Réjkjavik took shape. Inspired by this dart board approach are other capitals like *Kérisant-Civem*, and cities like *Keustellet* and Kirwijec.
## Sorskist
Harbour city to the northwest of Thórirsant, allows for intercontinental connections and trade to the other continents. Next to trade, Sorskist also serves as the *Ubunian Harbour* for the **Álusken-Thórirsant Ferry**.

## Kirwijec
## Sléta
## Nóve Osló
It's still unclear what will be done with the city of Nóve Osló project-wise. This city was founded after the Oslo revolution, which the Persson family and the Seventh Léjtuse also connect to, but considering how the course of the project has gone over the last years, the drafted story from 2019 no longer properly fits, so both the Oslo revolution and the city of Nóve Osló are drafts as of now (Dec 2022).
## Ljivk
Founded soon after the settlement that landed on Luniks, Ljivk is a city focused purely on the construction of space transport, for both passenger and cargo shipments. Long before the first Starships landed on Luniks, Ljivk was already noted on the map on Ubunia, because it was a perfect location for mining the required materials used in spaceship production. After the immense demand for space travel plummeted when Luniks was properly settled, the priorities shifted to planetary travel and further researching and developing maglev technology.
## Némiskéi
## Meskitái
To reduce the extreme load on Sórskist as the nation of Thórirsant continued to grow exponentially, a new harbour was built on the coastal city of Meskitái, intended to divert the stream of ships away from Sórskist and reduce its stress.
