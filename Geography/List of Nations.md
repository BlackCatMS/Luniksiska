// **NOTE**: As you can see, two continents are currently mostly empty spaces, with no nations located within these continents. This opens up room for additions later on as the planet properly takes shape! This section will be adjusted accordingly to changes regarding the nations and layout of the planet. 

# Ubunia
Ubunia was the first continent out of four on the planet to be settled. Right in the very heart of the western wing of the continent, Thórirsonn set foot and settled the city of Nóve Réjkjavik, before the imminent boom in further developments throughout the continent.

# Vestia
Soon after **Ubunia** was officially settled and divided up into several zones with nations, **Vestia** was next to be partitioned. Several nations on Earth that had lost the majority of their land and needed relocation elsewhere, like the Benelux and Denmark, were granted a sizeable strip of land on which they could relocate their citizens on, free from the threat of rising water levels.
## Álusken

## Benelux

## Denmark

## Zhuehai

## Vao

## Mónsan Republic
