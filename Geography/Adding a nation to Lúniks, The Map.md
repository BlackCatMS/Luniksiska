# Adding a nation to Luniks 

Adding a nation to the entire planet of Luniks might not seem like a fairly hard task, it should be no harder than plotting on the map, attaching a name and flag to it and leaving it to simmer while new info slowly starts to stick to it. Unfortunately, it's not that easy, but how come it's not?


## The Map
As spotted before, the map remains unfinished from an eagle-eyed view, only a small set of countries is shown over a huge continent, but apart from that, it remains empty. It's comparable to spotting North America, and believing it's the entire planet, it just doesn't work that way. The map itself has also been created in 2020, and ever since, the project has taken many different turns, some countries shrank in size, or even split up, merged with others, or new ones took the spot. But one questions arises to the top: How can we fix this map?

### A set of potential countries that could claim land on Lúniks
- **The Netherlands** *(lit. Benelux/Greater Netherlands)* | Having lost most of their land to the rising sea level on Earth, it's practically a given that Benelux can thrive and continue their progress on Lúniks, where the threat of rising sea levels and floodings is far smaller than it is now on Earth (2046)
- **Denmark** | Similarly to Benelux, Denmark has lost many of its islands as well as its land to the sea. Proposed is that Denmark will claim a set of land under Álusken, next to where Benelux is expected to receive and claim land.
- **Japan/Korea** 
- **Sórskist** | Attempting to secede from Thórirsant, Sórskist would lie and become independent in a roughly 2700km² area in the northwest of Thórirsant. This is heavily opposed both within Thórirsant and Sórskist, however, meaning the odds of Sórskist succesfully seceding are close to zero.
- **Rhódisz** | As Máneá continues to crumble further apart after Zakh'háfo's sudden secession, Rhódisz also attempts to secede, claiming an area of roughly 7600km² between Máneá and Zakh'háfo.
- **Kósfrii** *(Post-war)* | Being forcefully excluded from any sort of support from Thórirsant, Kósfrii sits in the middle of Thórirstant as an enclave, ending up as a smaller San Marino.


## The issue, resumed
But even with this ever-growing list of potential nations, some already existing on Earth, how can we be sure there'll even be enough space for all of them? How can we prevent conflicts from occurring?

### Existing Conflicts
Even taking into account that merging or splitting countries and their land mass among each other might sound easy in theory, it already proves it isn't, with the United Máneán country suddenly collapsing and creating separate countries of Máneá and Zakh'háfo, including the attempted secession of Rhódiś.
