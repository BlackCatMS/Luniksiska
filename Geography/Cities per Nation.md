# List of cities per Nation

## Continents
Luniks has four continents over the entire planet, each containing a landmass similar to Africa or South America. The four continents can be divided up into countries as well, as follows:
### Ubunia (Central continent)
- Thórirsant
- Ellitróómi
- Kérisant
- Máneá
- Zakh'háfo
- Léjtis
- Rhódisz (Disputed)

### Vestia (Upper left half)
- Kingdom of Álusken
- Benelux
- Denmark
- Mónsan Republic
- Zhuehai
- Hédenis
- Morrésik (Unregulated mountains)

### Skádia (Lower left half)
- 
### Deónia (Right half)
- 


// As you can see, two continents are currently completely empty spaces, with no countries located within these continents. This opens up room for additions later on as the planet properly takes shape! This section will be adjusted accordingly to changes regarding the nations and layout of the planet. 

## Thórirsant
#### Nóve Réjkjavik (Capital)
Named after the city of birth of Jonathán þórirsson, founder and first settler of the planet of Lúniks. Commonly referred to as "Capital of the planet". \
The city is best known for its "dart board" approach to city district planning. It's divided into a circle with eight slices, each of which have three layers, going from main district (city center) and residential areas -> park area and roads -> district centers and residential areas. This type of layering was suggested by Xárif Álufxent, a close friend of þórirsson who studied architecture and expertise in urban planning. Together with a team that was formed at the university he studied at, the foundations and blueprints for Nóve Réjkjavik took shape.

#### Sorskist
Harbour city to the northwest of Thórirsant, allows for intercontinental connection and trade, most importantly with Zhuehai and Álusken.

#### Kósfrii
*// The following text is from an older draft. Since then, the timescales have changed, meaning the below timestamps are subject to change*
City most notable by its civil war after a fallen local government, lasting from 2166 to 2172. The end of this war is noted in the [[Liétivus Pact,  Mar 30 2168]] document.

#### Kirwijets

#### Sléta

#### Nóve Osló
It's still unclear what will be done with the city of Nóve Osló project-wise. This city was founded after the Oslo revolution, which the Persson family and the Seventh Léjtuse also connect to, but considering how the course of the project has gone over the last years, the drafted story from 2019 no longer properly fits, so both the Oslo revolution and the city of Nóve Osló are drafts as of now (Dec 2022).

#### Ljívk
Founded soon after the settlement that landed on Luniks, Ljívk is a city focused purely on the construction of space transport, for both passenger and cargo shipments. Long before the first Starships landed on Luniks, Ljívk was already noted on the map on Ubinia, because it was a perfect location for mining the required materials used in spaceship production. After the immense demand for space travel plummeted when Luniks was properly settled, the priorities shifted to planetary travel and further researching and developing maglev technology.

#### Némiskéi

#### Meskitái
To reduce the extreme load on Sórskist as the nation of Thórirsant continued to grow exponentially, a new harbour was built on the coastal city of Meskitái, intended to divert the stream of ships away from Sórskist and reduce its stress. 

#### Kasztávje


## Ellitroomi
#### Ellitróómi-Páánsik (Capital)

#### Jullitáánah

#### Senttrikáá

#### Sáttijáárva


## Kérisant
#### Kérisant-Civem (Capital)
Literally meaning "Kérisant-City", Kérisant-Civem is the place to be for the most authentic cultural experiences in South-Ubunia. Deep within the city centre remains older architecture, having become obsolete soon after the first wave of the Luniksan revolution passed. However, even with the short-lasted construction revolution, some buildings still maintain this original style even far into the future, such as the *Kérisantic town hall*, and *Kérisant-Centrále*, the busiest railway station within the nation.

#### Kérisant-Bilczat

*// Below is a drafted story written in 2021, but as described above under Nóve Osló, the description clashes with what is currently on the table and timeline, so in the final lore, this might not be the same as written below*
##### Lake Dnherá is located near Kérisant-Bilćat, which itself is near the capital of Kérisant

Lake Dnherá is located right in the very center of the Bilćat District in central Kérisant. It lays east to the Kérisant-Bilćat train station, as well as the storage warehouses for numerous transport firms throughout Kérisant.  

"Lake Dnherá used to be visited by lots of different people, it was one of the most popular tourist attractions, after all. After the Collapse of Nóve-Osló in 2303, tourism collapsed along with it, leaving Lake Dnherá completely empty of visitors, yet this allowed the surrounding areas to flourish, giving life to new colours, lightening up Bilćat in ways never seen before." \
One thing to note here, is that the supposed collapse of Nóve-Osló in 2303 causes a collapse in tourism as well surrounding Lake Dnherá. As the development progressed, the city of Nóve-Osló was moved to be located in Thórirsant instead, meaning that the two events cannot be a cause & affect of one another. This is noted down and will be adjusted in the future!

#### Petrívo

#### Maríaporta super Égicmar
Maríaporta is a small port city located above the Égicmar lake (Égic's lake), further connecting Kérisant to other nations further out on the planet.

#### Mászdam

#### Cévok
Two events are drafted within this city, namely:
- Tiái Czi 203 Factory and its 2246 fireworks explosion
- Leremkov's labs

Leremkov's labs, and the investigation that was launched to find out the exact reasons how the Leremkov virus came to spread, are thoroughly detailed in [[BREACH]].

#### Weshalt


## Zakh'háfo (Zakh'háfónai Ertbitsai)
#### Ákros (Capital)
After a sudden split from United Máneá, Ákros was left in a fallen, newly formed country, already facing a deep recession right from the start. Nonetheless, Ákros serves home to the new financial district of Zakh'háfo, which is set to be the centre of economic growth for the future of not only Ákros and its surrounding villages, but to bloom Zakh'háfo as a whole.

#### Bwiskvá

#### Nepestésá

#### Álef

#### Dápos


## Máneá (Unifísai Ertbitsai da Máneá)
#### Fsát-Hokh (Capital)
Together with Zakh'háfo, Máneá entered a similar economic recession quickly after gaining independence. However, due to the uprising in civil unrest soon after the forcefully created government tried to limit the everyday life of its citizens in hopes to restore the collapsing economy, the capital soon collapsed under its own weight. 

#### Deth-Kelétam


#### Amadnésam
Before the collapse of **United Máneá**, Amadnésam was considered to be the research capital of Máneá, a title it retained after the collapse for another few years, until the economic collapse of the entire country. The city had been divided into several zone, which included various residential zones, an economic district, and research/science districts, all connected through a tightly woven metro network. 

## Rhódisz
#### Kristensend (Capital)


## Álusken
#### Álusken (Capital)
This city is most known for its giant castle in the centre of the city, home to the current King Álusken II. It's most known for its medieval looks and feel, especially in the center of the city, almost making it feel like a time capsule that leads to 700 years back in the past, despite being a city of barely 50 years old. Outside Álusken is a grand, wild forest, known for its mysterious events and creatures that may hide inside (See: [[Álusken's Mysteries]]).

#### Keustellet
Unlike the capital, Keustellet is a very modern city, matching the looks of Cévok, Sattijáárva, and Sórskist, with skyscrapers nested tightly together in the city centres and broad parks and housing spreading over the rest of the city. This modern cityscape can exist for Keustellet too, since Álusken II's rule does not cover Keustellet, which means it doesn't need to adhere the building and design standards of the capital.

#### Ippavím


## Zhuehai

#### Matéiazhu (Capital)

#### Nóve Guangdong

#### Tsechung la Porta

#### Shánzhe


## Monsán Republic 


## Hédenis
Hédenis has a very concrete way of naming cities and towns influenced by their mayors or founders, and the nature around them, creating a compounded word of settler + location. An example is "Myloukos géid Ygaris", a smaller city located at the river of Ygaris, settled by Stéiffra Myloukos. It would translate to "Myloukos at Ygaris", and can also be written as "Myloukos géid Ysani" (Myloukos at the river), but is not commonly used as it's not exactly clear.
#### Myriakos (Capital)


### Coastal cities (Port - Polou)
#### Myriapolou

#### Girréiapolou

#### Yledeypolou

#### Sevásipolou


### Mountainous cities (Mountain - Gerou)

#### Nedeigerou

#### Elysgerou
