// **NOTE**: As you can see, two continents are currently completely empty spaces, with no countries located within these continents. This opens up room for additions later on as the planet properly takes shape! This section will be adjusted accordingly to changes regarding the nations and layout of the planet. 

# Ubunia
Ubunia was the first continent out of four on the planet to be settled. Right in the very heart of the western wing of the continent, Þórirsson set foot and settled the city of Nóve Réjkjavik, before the imminent boom in further developments throughout the continent.

Soon after **Ubunia** was officially settled and divided up into several zones with nations, **Vestia** was next to be partitioned.
