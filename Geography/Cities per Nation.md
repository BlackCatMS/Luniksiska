# List of cities per Nation

## Thórirsant
#### Nóve Réjkjavik (Capital)
Named after the city of birth of Jonathán þórirsson, founder and first settler of the planet of Lúniks. Commonly referred to as "Capital of the planet". \
The city is best known for its "dart board" approach to city district planning. It's divided into a circle with eight slices, each of which have three layers, going from main district (city center) and residential areas -> park area and roads -> district centers and residential areas. This type of layering was suggested by Xárif Álufxent, a close friend of þórirsson who studied architecture and expertises in urban planning. Together with a team that was formed at the university he studied at, the foundations and blueprints for Nóve Réjkjavik took shape.

#### Sorskist
Harbour city to the northwest of Thórirsant, allows for intercontinental connection and trade, most importantly with Zhuehai and Álusken.

#### Kósfrii
City most notable by its civil war after a fallen local government, lasting from 2166 to 2172. The end of this war is noted in the [Liétivus Pact](obsidian://open?vault=Luniks&file=Historic%20Events%2FLi%C3%A9tivus%20Pact%2C%20%20Mar%2030%202168) document.

#### Kirŭijets

#### Sléta

#### Nóve Osló
It's still unclear what will be done with the city of Nóve Osló project-wise. This city was founded after the Oslo revolution, which the Persson family and the Seventh Léjtuse also connect to, but considering how the course of the project has gone over the last years, the drafted story from 2019 no longer properly fits, so both the Oslo revolution and the city of Nóve Osló are drafts as of now (Dec 2022).

#### Jullitáánah

#### Senttrikáá

## Kérisant
#### Kérisant-Civem (Capital)
Literally meaning "Kérisant-City", Kérisant-Civem is the place to be for the most authentic cultural experiences in South-Ubius. Deep within the city centre remains older architecture, having become obsolete soon after the first wave of the Luniksan revolution passed. 

#### Kérisant-Bilćat
##### Lake Dnherá is located near Kérisant-Bilćat, which itself is near the capital of Kérisant

Lake Dnherá is located right in the very center of the Bilćat District in central Kérisant. It lays east to the Kérisant-Bilćat train station, as well as the storage warehouses for numerous transport firms throughout Kérisant.  

*Below is a drafted story written in 2021, but as described above under Nóve Osló, the description clashes with what is currently on the table and timeline, so in the final lore, this might not be the same as written below*

"Lake Dnherá used to be visited by lots of different people, it was one of the most popular tourist attractions, after all. After the Collapse of Nóve-Osló in 2303, tourism collapsed along with it, leaving Lake Dnherá completely empty of visitors, yet this allowed the surrounding areas to flourish, giving life to new colours, lightening up Bilćat in ways never seen before."

#### Petrívo

#### Másidam

#### Cévok
Two events are drafted within this city, namely:
- Tiái Ći 203 Factory and its 2246 fireworks explosion
- Leremkov's labs

While Leremkov's labs have been mentioned in [Vitaly Leremkov](Vitaly%20Leremkov,%202039-2098), what actually happened in these labs in Cévok remains unclear.

## Zakh'háfo (Zakh'háfónai Ertbitsai)
#### Ákros (Capital)

Nonetheless, Ákros serves home to the new financial district of Zakh'háfo, which is set to be the centre of economic growth for the future of not only Ákros and its surrounding villages, but to bloom Zakh'háfo as a whole.
