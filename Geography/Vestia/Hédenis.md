# Hédenis
Hédenis has a very concrete way of naming cities and towns influenced by their mayors or founders, and the nature around them, creating a compounded word of settler + location. An example is "Myloukos géid Ygaris", a smaller city located at the river of Ygaris, settled by Stéiffra Myloukos. It would translate to "Myloukos at Ygaris", and can also be written as "Myloukos géid Ysani" (Myloukos at the river), but is not commonly used as it's not exactly clear.
