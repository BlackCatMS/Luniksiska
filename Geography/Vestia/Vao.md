# Vao
Setting forth the ancient culture that was prominent in Zhuehai and Álusken birthed the nation of Vao. A lot of traditional art that slowly was phased out during the intense growth within Zhuehai remained within Vao, making it stand out as its own strong nation, instead of being referred to as a "Zhuehai province", which it originally was. \

Within Vao, a strong culture surrounding these cultures remains, and is reflected especially through its smaller towns near the centre of the nation within the hills. Most towns here commonly share names with those of the dragons that are believed to have "once roamed the hills of Vao". Connected with [[Álusken's Mysteries]], it's believed that the cultures that are so prominent within Vao might be playing a role in the strange events that occur in Álusken, 
## Zháhi (Capital)
Despite being the capital of the nation, Zháhi is merely the third biggest city within Vao. Behind Lasz and Sevennur, Zháhi had chosen to maintain its ancient cultures and redirect and sort of expansion to neighbouring cities, keeping the original and classical architecture that once thrived in the mountains an identifying feature for its capital, while the other cities can thrive and grow in size without limits.
## Lasz
With a beautiful blend of classical Vaon architecture and modern, sharp styles, Lasz is the biggest city within Vao. Growing limitless in the south of the nation, it's easily accessible by its neighbouring nations and isn't troubled by the otherwise mountainous regions throughout the rest of the nation.
## Sevennur
Located on the border of Álusken, much of the local Álusken culture remains dominant in this city.

Also written as "**Hási Donnore**", because of the strong dialects within the Northern Vaon hills.
