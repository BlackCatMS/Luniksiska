# Vao
Setting forth the ancient culture that was prominent in Zhuehai and Álusken birthed the nation of Vao. A lot of traditional art that slowly was phased out during the intense growth within Zhuehai remained within Vao, making it stand out as its own strong nation, instead of being referred to as a "Zhuehai province", which it originally was. \
