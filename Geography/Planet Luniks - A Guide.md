# Planet Luniks- A Guide
*Note: Much like worldbuilding in general, designing something from scratch that has only lived in your mind for as long as you remember, isn't an easy feat. This means everything is very subject to change, or removal. If you're reading this, thank you for spending your time diving into my mind!*

## Like Earth, unlike Earth
**Luniks** shares a lot of similarities to **Earth**. Back in the 1970s, after the Cold War had reached its end, the Space Race continued onwards and a hunt for the first exoplanet became a reality. In **1990**, The **Messier 45** system was found, and soon after the planet of Luniks — Then known as Choreos-RP-4 — it became clear that the space agencies had struck gold in the habitable zone of the **Choreos** sun.
