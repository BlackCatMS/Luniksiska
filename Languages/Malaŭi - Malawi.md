# Malawi

Malawi is a spoken language spanning across the territory of Malau, commonly being referred to as a "basic yet in-depth language". Being centralised entirely within Malau, some people bordering Malaw also know a few words or sentences in Malawi, creating opportunities for trade, when English or Luniksan aren't widely available. 


## Origin and History
Having been developed entirely within the territory of Malau, it's mostly similar to modern Indonesian and Malaysian, with its roots reaching back to Asian languages with European influences. Despite having these roots, it's still misunderstood and there's a lot of false friends with English. Currently, it's spoken within Malaw with spots surrounding the territory of people recognising and understanding the language, but not being as fluent as native Malawi people. 


## Writing system and script

Malawi uses the exact same script as Modern English.
