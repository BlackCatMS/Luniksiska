# Lúniksiska
Luniksian is a spoken language spanning across most of the inhabited area on the greatest continent on Luniks, primarily spanning the territories of Thórirsant and Kérisant, whose names are also derived from Luniksian naming schemes (Thórir's land, Kéris' land). 

## Origin and history
The origin of Luniksian is yet to be determined. It mostly derives from western European languages like Dutch, German, and English, but takes a lot of vocabulary and similarities to Nordic languages as well, despite visually looking a lot like Hungarian. It's believed that the language was brought to life over time while people were gradually starting to inhabit the newly discovered planet of Luniks, which was mostly done by Europeans at the time. Because of this increasingly growing language barrier, it became hard for people to adapt to each other's new homes, as each respective language began to look similar and blend in together, eventually creating the language of Luniksian, named after the planet, a blend of all these vastly different European languages.


## Writing system and script

Luniksian has two official scripts, one being the standard Latin alphabet, the other being a completely localised and more unique script, often referred to as "Mithrí". 

### Latin
The Latin script used in Luniksian is visually identical, with the addition and removal of some letters otherwise seen in languages like English. The character set is as follows:

**AÁBCĆDEÉFGHIÍJKLMNOÓPRSŚTUÚVŬXZ**

There are some clear standouts within this character set, but let's take a closer look at the basic alphabet first and what it's most comparable to in English:
- **A**: P**a**th
- **Á**: There isn't really a word in English that is similar to this sound, it's comparable to the Dutch "aa", or if you put an emphasis on the "A" in "Mali"
- **B**: **B**ark
- **C**: Pu**ts**
- **Ć**: **Ch**ore
- **D**: **D**og
- **E**: P**e**t
- **É**: B**ay** (But it sounds more like "ey")
- **F**: **F**our
- **G**: **G**oal
- **H**: **H**owl
- **I**: Th**i**s
- **Í**: M**ee**t
- **J**: **Y**oung
- **K**: **C**all
- **L**: **L**ong
- **M**: **M**oth
- **N**: **N**ot
- **O**: B**o**x
- **Ó**: L**o**cal
- **P**: **P**en
- **R**: The R is a rolling R in Luniksian, and there is no comparable word in English since English doesn't have a rolling R
- **S**: **S**et
- **Ś**: **Sh**ock
- **T**: **T**ough
- **U**: M**u**st
- **Ú**: Y**ou** (With an emphasis on the "u", making it sound more like "Yuu")
- **V**: **V**eer
- **Ŭ**: **Wh**en
- **X**: **Sh**ut
- **Z**: Bu**zz**

Some things to note:
- **Ś** and **X** sounds and are identical, and the letters are interchangable within the language as well, both are represented and understood and are accepted as well. The word "English" can be written both ways: "Angliśká" and "Anglixká".
- **J** can be pronounced as both **J**ungle and **Y**oung, but the only way to actually figure out which of the two you have to use is completely contextual, and is a matter of knowing the language. This makes it hard for someone who doesn't speak Luniksian to differentiate the two, as it's very prone to switching up.
- **Ŭ** is sometimes transliterated as **W**, since it's a more accessible letter, and is more easily recognised and understood.
- Accented vowels like **Á**, **É**, traditionally define the emphasis in a word, but in the case of multiple accented vowels, the emphasis will always be on the second to last vowel.
- Although not explicitly listed, the Luniksian script contains an accentuated **K**, and despite its existence, its only usage is with loanwords containing the /x/ sound, which by itself does not exist and is not used within Luniksian. This is most commonly transliterated as **KH**, see: "Lakh" /ləx/.
