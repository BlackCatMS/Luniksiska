# Ellitróómisi

Ellitroomi is a spoken language located entirely within the territory of Ellitroomi, commonly referred to as a "Confusing mess of letters", referring to its large set of double, or in some cases, triple vowels and consonants. 

## Origin and History

Ellitroomi has no clear origin or history; it's a complete mystery as to where it has originated from, but it shares a lot of similarity with Finnish and Estonian languages, most of that being visual similarities. It's exclusively spoken by the people inhabiting the territory of Ellitroomi, which borders to the East of Thórirsant and North of Kérisant. Its complexity and difficultness makes it a very hard language to get acquainted to, let alone learn, which is why it's a very isolated language.


## Writing system and script

Ellitroomi has only one currently recognised script, which is standard Latin. There have been several attempts to revive an older, even more incomprehensible script, which would make even more unique, yet also even harder to understand for foreigners.
