# Word Types
Similarly to various other Germanic languages, which Luniksan shares roots with and is a part of, Luniksan has the following word types:

### Articles
- **La** kac - ("**The** cat")
- **La** hús - ("**The** house")

Luniksan actively tries to avoid gendered words, or words that have varying articles without a proper way to distinguish them, like in Dutch (De/Het) or in Swedish (En/Ett). Similarly to English, the only article possible is **La**, just like "The" in English. 

### Nouns
- La **kac** - ("The **cat**")
- La **hús** - ("The **house**")

### Verbs 
- Mi **danség** - ("I **dance**")
- On **usájéra** - ("We **use**")

### Adjectives
- La **grande** hús - ("The **big** house")
- La **líle** kac - ("The **small** cat")

Adjectives in Luniksan usually always end in -e to distinguish them from other words in the sentence and clarify that it's an adjective, although positioning also plays a major role in this, this will be explained later.

### Pronouns
- **Mi** danség - ("**I** dance")
- **On** usájéra - ("**We** use")

### Conjunctions
This is still being actively debated, so this is subject to change and subject to finalisation, but as of now, these are the two proposed conjunction words:
- La kac **i** la hund  ("The cat **and** the dog")
- La kac **é** la hund - ("The cat **and** the dog")

### Prepositions
- La kac ést **sim** la hús - ("The cat is **in** the house")


# Word Order
Like said before, Luniksan is very similar to other Germanic languages, and word order is no different. Basic sentence structure is **Subject + Verb**, but some exceptions exist.

### Subject + Verb
- Mi danség - ("I dance") 
- Vi buskés - ("You search")

This is the most formal way to write a simple sentence like this, the subject is clear, and what they're doing is clear as well. In more casual forms, these can be simplified, sometimes even omitting the subject completely":

#### (Subject) + Verb
- M-ég - ("I am")
- Ć-ést - ("It is")

In these examples, the subject is shortened and directly connects to the verb with a hyphen (-). This is required, as it loses clarity and connection when the hyphen isn't there. 

#### Verb
- Danséra - ("We dance")
- Usájég - ("I use")

Both of these examples are allowd only in a casual manner. The subject can be omitted, because saying "Usájég će ("I use it")" already makes it clear that the person who is saying it will use it. As compared to "Usájés će ("You use it")", it becomes clear that the subject becomes the person that the sentence is being told to.

### Subject + Verb + Object
- Mi buskég la kac - ("I'm searching for the cat")
- Ili danséram sim la park - ("They dance in the park")

The object in a sentence *always* comes after the subject and its verb. The only exceptions are when the object becomes the topic of the sentence, in the sense of "The park I'm walking in", but this will be properly explained later.

### Subject + Verb + Object (Direct) + Object (Indirect)
- Mi parlég kun moi padre sur la hus - ("I talk to my father about the house")
