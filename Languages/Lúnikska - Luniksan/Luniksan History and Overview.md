# Lúnikska
Luniksan is a spoken language spanning across most of the inhabited area on the greatest continent on Luniks, primarily spanning the territories of Thórirsant and Kérisant, whose names are also derived from Luniksan naming schemes (Thórir's land, Kéris' land). 

## Origin and history
The origin of Luniksan is yet to be determined. It mostly derives from western European languages like Dutch, German, and English, but takes a lot of vocabulary and similarities to Nordic languages as well, despite visually looking a lot like Hungarian. It's believed that the language was brought to life over time while people were gradually starting to inhabit the newly discovered planet of Luniks, which was mostly done by Europeans at the time. Because of this increasingly growing language barrier, it became hard for people to adapt to each other's new homes, as each respective language began to look similar and blend in together, eventually creating the language of Luniksan, named after the planet, a blend of all these vastly different European languages.


## Writing system and script

Luniksan has two official scripts, one being the standard Latin alphabet, the other being a completely localised and more unique script, known as Mithrí. 

### Mithrí
Mithrí has been the unique identifying script that first developed around the Máneán area on Luniks. Ever since, it has gradually spread throughout the continent and is now most noticeable in Thórirsant, Máneá, and Kérisant. An Ellitróómi version of this script exists, but hasn't been properly documented as of yet. \
This table is read as follows, left to right, top to bottom:
- **Vowels**: A, E, I, O, U
- **Consonants, row 1**: B, C, D, F, G
- **Consonants, row 2**: H, J, K, L, M
- **Consonants, row 3**: N, P, R, S, R
- **Consonants, row 4**: V, W, Z
- **Accents, row 1**: Á, É, Í, Ó, Ú
- **Accents, row 2**: Ć/*CS*, Ś/*SZ*, Ź/*ZS*

There isn't much documentation yet written in Luniksan, let alone in Mithrí, as this language and this script aren't anywhere close to being near-functional as a language. As time progresses and this project grows, slowly but sure the amount of documentation in Luniksan and Mithrí will grow.

### Latin
The Latin script used in Luniksan is visually identical to Latin as most Europeans know, with the addition and removal of some letters otherwise seen in languages like English. The character set is as follows:

**A Á B C Ć D E É F G H I Í J K L M N O Ó P R S Ś T U Ú V W X Z**

There are some clear standouts within this character set, but let's take a closer look at the basic alphabet first and what it's most comparable to in English:
- **A**: P**a**th
- **Á**: There isn't really a word in English that is similar to this sound, it's comparable to the Dutch "aa", or if you put an emphasis on the "A" in "Mali"
- **B**: **B**ark
- **C**: Pu**ts**
- **Ć**: **Ch**ore
- **D**: **D**og
- **E**: P**e**t
- **É**: B**ay** (But it sounds more like "ey")
- **F**: **F**our
- **G**: **G**oal
- **H**: **H**owl
- **I**: Th**i**s
- **Í**: M**ee**t
- **J**: **J**ungle
- **K**: **C**all
- **L**: **L**ong
- **M**: **M**oth
- **N**: **N**ot
- **O**: B**o**x
- **Ó**: L**o**cal
- **P**: **P**en
- **R**: The R is a rolling R in Luniksan, and there is no comparable word in English since English doesn't have a rolling R
- **S**: **S**et
- **Ś**: **Sh**ock
- **T**: **T**ough
- **U**: M**u**st
- **Ú**: Y**ou** (With an emphasis on the "u", making it sound more like "Yuu")
- **V**: **V**eer
- **W**: **Wh**en
- **X**: **Sh**ut
- **Z**: Bu**zz**

Some things to note:
- **Ś** and **X** sound and are identical, and the letters are interchangable within the language as well, both are represented and understood and are accepted as well. The word "English" can be written both ways: "Angliśká" and "Anglixká".
- **J** can be pronounced as ~~both~~ **J**ungle ~~and **Y**oung, but the only way to actually figure out which of the two you have to use is completely contextual, and is a matter of knowing the language. This makes it hard for someone who doesn't speak Luniksan to differentiate the two, as it's very prone to switching up.~~ **(2023 edit: This has been revised and is now only pronounced the same way Jungle is. The Y sound in Young is now written with an I: "La Maiai" (The Maya's))**
- ~~**Ŭ** is sometimes transliterated as **W**, since it's a more accessible letter, and is more easily recognised and understood.~~ **(2023 edit: Ŭ has been replaced completely by W, as this is the more legible option)**
- Accented vowels like **Á**, **É**, traditionally define the emphasis in a word, but in the case of multiple accented vowels, the emphasis will always be on the second to last vowel.
- Although not explicitly listed, the Luniksan script contains an accentuated **K**, and despite its existence, its only usage is with loanwords containing the /x/ sound, which by itself does not exist and is not used within Luniksan. This is most commonly transliterated as **KH**, see: "Lakh" /ləx/.
